**Spec version:** 1.0.0-draft.1
**Purpose:** Non-technical reference for evaluating WOS capabilities against competing platforms.

## How to Read This Document

**WOS Capability Status:**

| Icon | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| ✅ | Fully Specified and Implemented in Reference Stack |
| 🟦 | Specified and partially implemented |
| 🟡 | Specified in prose and schema; implementation pending |
| ⚪ | Referenced or planned; specification pending |

**Current implementation caveat:** `wos-runtime` owns reference companion policy, event identity, and runtime/core provenance emission; `wos-conformance` observes those behaviors. `wos-formspec-binding` implements the full S15 protocol with binding-backed conformance fixtures; `ConformanceBinding` and `StubValidator` have been deleted (S15.3 complete).

**Competitor Support:**

## 15. Strategic Position

### WOS Governs Existing Engines

Existing engines define **how** work flows. WOS defines **how work is governed**.

#### WOS inherits engine capabilities through bindings:

1. BPMN visual notation and mature tooling.
2. FEEL/DMN decision tables with production implementations.
3. WS-HumanTask lifecycle and task management UIs.
4. Process persistence and crash recovery.
5. Existing government deployments and developer communities.

#### Unique WOS capabilities:

1. **Deontic governance:** Structurally enforces Permission/Prohibition/Obligation/Right.
2. **Four-layer audit with epistemic status:** Separates verified facts, AI narratives, and counterfactuals.
3. **Structured oversight protocols:** Builds interface protocols (like independent-first) into the task lifecycle.
4. **Due process as a structural requirement:** Enforces appeal topology, continuation-of-service, and counterfactual explanation constraints.
5. **Universal interface contract:** Employs one spec for human forms, agent I/O, decision services, and integrations.
6. **Constraint zones:** Verifies satisfiability of declarative case management within statecharts.
7. **Formally verifiable constraints:** Provable governance properties via SMT.
8. **JSON-LD native:** Every WOS document is a valid RDF graph.
