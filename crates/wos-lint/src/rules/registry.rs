// Rust guideline compliant 2026-02-21

//! Rule metadata registry for all currently-implemented lint rules.
//!
//! The registry is the single source of truth for "what rules exist in code"
//! — separate from [`LINT-MATRIX.md`], which is the source of truth for
//! "what rules the spec normatively requires." Gaps between the two are
//! rule-coverage gaps.
//!
//! Every rule currently starts at [`Graduation::Draft`] with an empty
//! [`RuleMetadata::fixtures`] list. Promotion through the ladder
//! (Draft → Tested → Stable → LoadBearing) is handled by follow-up work
//! described in `thoughts/plans/2026-04-16-wos-rule-coverage-conformance.md`.
//!
//! # Adding a new rule
//!
//! When introducing a new lint diagnostic, add a [`RuleMetadata`] entry to
//! [`ALL_LINT_RULES`] with `graduation: Graduation::Draft` and an empty
//! `fixtures` slice. Promotion is performed in a separate change once the
//! rule has at least one passing fixture.
