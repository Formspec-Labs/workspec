//! Durable pending-obligation monitor (ADR 0096; Governance §16.2).
//!
//! Centralizes obligation lifecycle logic as pure functions over a
//! [`WorkflowProcess`] and an [`ObligationEvent`]. Mirrors the
//! [`crate::milestones`] shape: each function reads the process state, mutates
//! [`GovernanceState::pending_obligations`], and returns the provenance records
//! it appended (in deterministic order). The functions have no side effects
//! beyond the provided process and the returned provenance buffer, so they are
//! unit-testable in isolation and safe to slot into the runtime drain loop.
//!
//! Event-processing order within a drain step (Governance §16.2.3):
//! `pre_event_gate` (may block) → kernel event → `evaluate_activations` /
//! `evaluate_satisfactions` / `evaluate_cancellations`. Deadline timers
//! (WOS-OBL-TIME-*) are layered on top of this module by the timer path.
