# wos-server Parity Matrix

_Cross-references `/specs` + `/schemas` against the server's HTTP + Socket.IO surface on branch `claude/wos-spec-backend-y17wJ` as of commit `645fbd8`._

> **Validation pass applied** (commit `d61b2af` → `9a063ad`). Three independent audits flagged 6 citation errors, 1 path fabrication (`/api/kernels` → actual `/api/bundles`), 4 mis-graded rows, an unsorted "ranked" table, and 4 unfair critiques. All applied.
>
> **DI seam rework applied** (2026-04-18). Re-framed the gap list around Runtime §12 host-interface seams. Two seams are unwired (`ProvenanceSigner`, `ReportRenderer`) — both top-ROI. Three seams are wired-but-stubbed (`AccessControl` permissive, `ContractValidator` permissive, `ExternalService` echo) — tightening them to policy-composing impls is the bulk of envelope-stack readiness. The "provenance attestation" row was dropped from the ranking entirely: it's a consumer-injected plug via `ProvenanceSigner`, not a server gap. Runtime §15.7 ledger-gating enforcement (missed in the prior validation pass) was added as the `PolicyLayeredValidator` item. The `/explain` handler line-count drops from 1-day to ~2-hours once `ReportRenderer` is wired.
>
> Paired spec-side planning lives in [`../../TODO.md §4.7`](../../TODO.md) — three new spec items (#58 envelope status, #59 CloudEvent envelope-flow catalog, #60 envelope reference fixtures) plus cross-ref annotations on existing items (#2, #20, #30, #38, #40, #43) that serve envelope-stack composition once they land.

**Methodology.** Walked each spec extracting every imperative observable (MUST statements on processor behaviour, enumerated operations, processor-obligation tables). Cross-referenced against `crates/wos-server/src/http/*.rs` routes, `realtime/mod.rs` events, and `runtime/mod.rs` methods. Schema files that define document shapes (not observables) are marked "spec-side" — they're consumed as validation inputs to `POST /api/lint/document`, not served as first-class resources.

**Status legend.**
- **full** — endpoint exists, response matches spec shape, real logic behind it
- **partial** — endpoint exists, covers main use case, missing edge cases
- **stub** — endpoint exists with spec-correct response shape, values are synthetic
- **none** — no server surface; spec obligates one
- **spec-side** — document-shape spec, no server surface expected

**User-value lens.** Every row is also evaluated for "does this solve a real user problem or is it cargo-cult compliance?" Rows flagged are collected in the _User-value critique_ section.

## Summary

| Status | Count |
|---|---|
| full | 27 |
| partial | 11 |
| stub | 6 |
| none | 11 |
| spec-side | 13 |
| **total** | **68** |

Kernel + runtime companion are mostly implemented (Runtime §12 has six of the spec's nine host interfaces wired). Governance L1 read-side and sidecar operations are solid. The gaps cluster in three places: (1) two unwired DI seams (`ProvenanceSigner`, `ReportRenderer`) that unblock attestation + explanation work, (2) integration-profile real dispatch (currently echo) plus correlation tokens, (3) semantic profile's SHACL / SPARQL (triplestore adapter needed). Stubs are concentrated in advanced L3 (SMT verification, drift detection) — both require external adapters; their response shapes are spec-correct so consumers can integrate today.

## DI seam status (Runtime §12 host interfaces)

`wos-runtime` composes nine host-interface traits defined in `wos-core::traits`. The envelope-stack framing (`TODO.md §4.7`) shows that every "signing ceremony" or "attestation" concern reduces to wiring a seam — consumers inject their signer / renderer / identity adapter / policy engine, and WOS stays out of the primitive business. The table below is the authoritative map of what's wired.

| Trait (`wos-core::traits`) | Server impl | Status | Envelope-stack use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `InstanceStore` | `storage::SqliteRuntimeStore` | wired (real) | ✓ |
| `DocumentResolver` | `runtime::BundleServiceResolver` | wired (real) | ✓ |
| `TaskPresenter` | `runtime::SocketIoTaskPresenter` | wired (real) | ✓ |
| `EventQueue` | folded into `WosRuntime` internal queue | wired (real) | ✓ |
| `AccessControl` | `runtime::PermissiveAccessControl` | wired (permissive stub) | **seam for separation-of-duties** — replace with `RoleBasedAccessControl` that honours Gov §7.2 / AI §1.5 |
| `ExternalService` | `runtime::EchoExternalService` | wired (echo stub) | **seam for integration dispatch** — replace with `IntegrationDispatchService` reading bindings from resolver |
| `ContractValidator` | `runtime::PermissiveValidator` | wired (permissive stub) | **seam for ledger-gating + signature-class enforcement** — replace with `PolicyLayeredValidator` that composes Formspec check + Runtime §15.7 gating + #43 class binding |
| `ProvenanceSigner` | **not wired** | **unwired** | **seam for attestation** — consumers inject `Ed25519FileKeySigner` / HSM / cloud KMS / Formspec Respondent Ledger client |
| `ReportRenderer` | **not wired** | **unwired** | **seam for explanation / COC / notice rendering** — consumers inject `JsonReportRenderer` (default) / `HtmlReportRenderer` / PDF |

Two seams are unwired. Both unblock envelope-critical work:

- Wiring `ProvenanceSigner` (default: `NoopSigner` with spec-correct envelope shape) closes the attestation axis. Consumers plug whatever signer they have.
- Wiring `ReportRenderer` (default: `JsonReportRenderer`) turns the `/instances/:id/explain` endpoint from a 1-day build into a ~50-line handler once the Runtime §9.1 deterministic algorithm (TODO.md #2, §4.1 critical path) lands.

Three seams are wired but stubbed. Tightening them from stub to policy-composing impl is the bulk of the envelope-stack server work:

- `AccessControl` permissive → `RoleBasedAccessControl` with separation-of-duties enforcement
- `ContractValidator` permissive → `PolicyLayeredValidator` with §15.7 ledger-gating + #43 signature-class check
- `ExternalService` echo → `IntegrationDispatchService` with real binding dispatch

**Framing consequence:** Every "build attestation" / "build explanation rendering" / "build identity proofing" concern the enterprise gap docs flag as a DocuSign-competitive requirement is a **seam composition** problem, not a net-new server module. The server's job is to accept the seam implementations consumers inject, enforce that they're wired for rights-impacting workflows, and stay out of the signing ceremony.

| AI §1.5 / Gov §7.2 | Separation of duties (agent must not review own output) | — | — | **none** | `PermissiveAccessControl::can_transition` returns `true` unconditionally; `AccessControl` trait has no method comparing actor identity to original author. **User value: high** — Gov §7.2 obligates this normatively (AI §1.5 informative table cross-references) |
| AI §4 Deontic constraints | Permissions / prohibitions / obligations for agents | — | `GET /api/governance/:url/deontic-constraints` | full | Shared endpoint |

| AI §tool use | Tool invocation authorization | — | `POST /api/agents/:id/tool-invocation-check` | **stub** | Returns `{allowed: status==active && deploymentState==production}` — a reasonable default but not the full spec |

### Agent Config (sidecar)

Spec: `specs/ai/agent-config.md`. Schema: `schemas/ai/wos-agent-config.schema.json`.

Largely **spec-side** — endpoint config, credentials refs, model version lists. Consumed through agent registration or bundle loading. Calibration expiry is the only behavioural obligation and is flagged above as "none".

### Drift Monitor (sidecar)

Spec: `specs/ai/drift-monitor.md`. Schema: `schemas/ai/wos-drift-monitor.schema.json`.

| section | capability | schema | endpoint | status | notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Drift §1.3 Monitor metrics | Serve drift report shaped by configured metrics | wos-drift-monitor | `GET /api/agents/:id/drift` | **stub** | Spec defines metric config shape (PSI / KS / threshold); doesn't obligate the processor to compute. Endpoint returns spec-correct envelope with `psi: null, ks: null`. **User value: medium** — real impls have an external detector write reports; suggested follow-up: add a write-side `POST /api/agents/:id/drift` so the GET serves the most-recent externally-produced report |
| Drift §1.4 Deployment sequence | Canary / shadow gating on drift | — | — | spec-side | Enforced at gateway, not server |

## Advanced Governance (L3)

Spec: `specs/advanced/advanced-governance.md`. Schema: `schemas/advanced/wos-advanced.schema.json`.

| section | capability | schema | endpoint | status | notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Advanced §3 Equity guardrails | Evaluate equity over window | wos-equity | `POST /api/equity/evaluate` | partial | Real group-by runs over instances; outcome predicate is stubbed (`Some(_) ⇒ false`). Result shape is spec-correct. **User value: high** — main equity observable |

| Advanced §4.4 Relation evaluation | Compute DCR marking → valid next actions | — | `GET /api/instances/:id/constraint-zones/:zone/valid-actions` | **stub** | Returns declared activities; real marking evaluation against provenance not implemented. **User value: medium** — DCR-style case management is niche today |
| Advanced §5 Multi-step sessions | Session start / continue / complete with cumulative-confidence gating | — | — | **none** | §5.4 specifies cumulative-confidence product across DAG steps with intervention-point checkpoints — distinct from kernel compound states (which have no confidence semantics). **User value: medium** — narrow consumer set (multi-step LLM reasoning chains) |
| Advanced §6 Verifiable constraints | SMT verification | wos-verification-report | `POST /api/verification/verify` | **stub** | Returns `inconclusive` for every constraint. Real proofs require `WOS_SMT=z3`. Shape is spec-correct — consumers can integrate today |

| Advanced §11 Circuit breaker | Agent-level breaker (errorRateThreshold / cooldownDuration / closed-open-half-open) | — | — | **none** | Agent-semantic — error rate of agent invocations feeds agent lifecycle state via `lifecycleHook`. Distinct from network-layer breakers a service mesh provides. **User value: medium** — standalone-agent deployments need it |

### Verification Report (sidecar)

Spec: `specs/advanced/verification-report.md`. Schema: `schemas/advanced/wos-verification-report.schema.json`.

**Spec-side** document — the output envelope of a verification run. Consumed via `POST /api/verification/verify` response and `GET /api/governance/:url/verification-report` projection.

| Assurance §5 Attestation | Provider-neutral attestation | — | — | **none** | No `/api/instances/:id/identity-facts/:id/attest`. **User value: medium** — legal-sufficiency deployments need attestation; low-assurance deployments don't |
| Assurance §6 Legal sufficiency disclosure | Disclosure metadata on exports when claims are made | — | — | **none** | §6.1 obligates a disclosure of which conditions an implementation relies on (process, signature semantics, records-management, applicable law) **when** the implementation makes claims about evidentiary weight. Server-side exports today make no such claims and therefore are technically compliant; if/when we add attestation (§5), exports must carry the disclosure. **User value: medium** — gating the attestation work, not currently blocking |
| Assurance §custody | Custody posture declaration | — | — | **none** | Plan had `GET /api/instances/:id/custody-posture` as a stretch. **User value: medium** — specialised to chain-of-custody workflows |

| BusCal §compute | Snap-forward deadline | wos-business-calendar | `POST /api/calendar/:url/compute-deadline` | full | Delegates to `wos_core::business_calendar::next_business_moment` |
| BusCal §business-days-between | Business-day delta | — | — | partial | Plan had `POST /api/calendar/:url/business-days-between`; the spec only obligates the deadline op, so this is optional. **User value: low** — trivial helper; clients can compose two `compute-deadline` calls |

### Notification Template

Spec: `specs/sidecars/notification-template.md`. Schema: `schemas/sidecars/wos-notification-template.schema.json`.

| section | capability | schema | endpoint | status | notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Notif §render | Template render with placeholder substitution | wos-notification-template | `POST /api/notifications/:url/render` | full | `${var}` + dotted `${nested.path}` supported |
| Notif §channels | Per-channel dispatch | — | — | spec-side | Delivery is out of scope for the server; template render returns declared channel list |

## User-value critique

Rows where the spec obligates a surface but the user value is questionable, and what we recommend.

### Low value — defer

1. **Semantic §6 SPARQL in-server.** In-process SPARQL requires an embedded triplestore and doesn't pay off for the usual "export → external tool" workflow. Users who need SPARQL have Apache Jena / Oxigraph already. Recommend: keep as optional feature behind `triplestore-oxigraph`; don't mark as MUST.
2. **AI §6 Fallback chain retrieval.** Fallback chains are typically driven by the agent registry at runtime, not queried by clients. The endpoint would have no real consumer. Recommend: leave as spec-side data on the AI integration doc; no dedicated endpoint.
3. **Runtime §Suspend / resume.** No evidence anyone uses these in practice. Recommend: lazy-implement when a real case comes in; don't build eagerly.
4. **Kernel §Correspondence template application.** Overlaps semantically with Notification template render (both shape outbound content). Recommend: clarify the boundary in the specs (correspondence = audit trail of *received* communication, notification = *outbound* content) — not a deletion case, but the surface area suggests merging or sharper delineation.

### High value — the real gaps

Rows where the spec is right and the missing surface is a concrete user-value block:

- **Runtime §9 / Gov §3.3 Explanation assembly.** Runtime §9 specifies the deterministic algorithm; Gov §3.3 specifies what must be delivered (individualised / categorical / aggregate by impact level). The two are a contract+implementation pair, not duplication. Server provides a *partial* surface today via the applicant-determination view; the dedicated `/instances/:id/explain` per Runtime §9.1 is missing.
- **Gov §5.4 Pipeline validation.** Assertion-gate pipelines have no run-against-inputs endpoint.
- **PolicyParam §1.3 As-of resolution.** Date-indexed policy resolution is the *whole point* of the policy-parameters sidecar and has no endpoint.
- **Integ §6 Correlation.** Async request/response (most interesting integrations) need correlation tokens; currently absent.
- **Gov §7.2 Separation of duties.** Spec normatively MUST-says actor cannot review own output (cross-referenced informatively in AI §1.5); `PermissiveAccessControl` permits it.
- **Assurance §3 Subject continuity.** Continuity-hash validation absent; chain endpoint exists but doesn't prove the chain.

### Spec smells

Ambiguities worth flagging on the spec side, but **not** grounds for unilateral server-side dismissal:

1. **Overlap between `correspondence-metadata` and `notification-template`.** Both define outbound content shapes. The boundary should be tightened in the specs — recommend an editorial pass, not a deletion.
2. **`assertion-library.md`** defines a reusable assertion shape but no spec actually declares how to *invoke* one. The `invokeAssertion` obligation is missing from `workflow-governance.md` §5.4. Recommend adding the invoke binding spec-side.

The previous version of this document also flagged Advanced §5 multi-step sessions, Advanced §11 circuit breakers, and Drift §1.3 as over-reach. Re-reading the specs more carefully:

- **Multi-step sessions (Advanced §5)** specify cumulative-confidence gating across DAG steps with intervention-point checkpoints — distinct from kernel compound states (which have no confidence semantics). Different abstractions; both have a place.
- **Circuit breakers (Advanced §11)** are agent-semantic (error rate of agent invocations feeding agent lifecycle state), not network-semantic. Service mesh breakers don't know what an agent's error predicate is. Defer if there's no consumer, but don't treat as over-reach.
- **Drift §1.3** only defines the *config shape* for drift metrics; nothing in the spec obligates the processor to compute them. The earlier "the processor structurally can't do this" critique was solving a non-problem.

## Asymmetries

### Schemas without specs

None — every schema under `/schemas` has a matching spec.

### Specs without schemas

None — every spec under `/specs` has a matching schema.

### Specs that define a shape but imply no server surface

These are document-shape specs that are (correctly) not exposed as resources; they flow through the generic validation and bundle-read surfaces:

- `schemas/kernel/wos-correspondence-metadata.schema.json` — validated via `/lint/document`
- `schemas/governance/wos-due-process.schema.json` — bundle projection
- `schemas/governance/wos-policy-parameters.schema.json` — bundle projection
- `schemas/governance/wos-assertion-gate.schema.json` — bundle projection
- `schemas/ai/wos-agent-config.schema.json` — bundle projection + agent registration
- `schemas/ai/wos-drift-monitor.schema.json` — bundle projection
- `schemas/advanced/wos-verification-report.schema.json` — output envelope from `/verification/verify`
- `schemas/advanced/wos-equity.schema.json` — bundle projection
- `schemas/assurance/wos-assurance.schema.json` — embedded in identity facts

## Gap ranking — priority × complexity × tech-debt burden

Every gap scored on three independent axes. **Priority** is user impact × urgency. **Complexity** is effort to close. **Debt burden** is the compounding cost of deferring — an isolated addition scores 1; a gap where every additional day spreads workarounds across the codebase or ossifies breaking-change exposure scores 5.

**Rubric.**
- **Priority (P)**: 5 = blocks conformance or legal-sufficiency gate · 3 = real consumer asks exist · 1 = spec curiosity.
- **Complexity (C)**: 1 = <1 hr · 2 = <1 day · 3 = 1-2 days · 4 = 3-5 days · 5 = multi-week or external adapter.
- **Debt burden (D)**: 5 = every week of delay compounds (consumers build on absence, retrofit is breaking) · 3 = downstream reinvention starts · 1 = pure addition.

### Ranked table

Sorted by ROI (= P × D / C; higher is more value-per-effort). **DI seam rework applied** (2026-04-18): items that were framed as "build attestation" / "build explanation" / "build identity-proofing" are re-cast as seam wiring. Complexity collapses — what was 1-day builds are now ~1-hour seam hook-ups. "Provenance attestation" leaves the ranking entirely (it's a consumer-injected plug via `ProvenanceSigner`, not a server gap). Runtime §15.7 ledger-gating enforcement is added (was missed in prior drafts).

| Gap | Spec § | P | C | D | ROI | Shape |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Wire `ProvenanceSigner` seam | Runtime §12.6 | 5 | 1 | 5 | **25.0** | Add `NoopSigner` + config; trait already in `wos-core::traits` |
| Wire `ReportRenderer` seam | Runtime §12.7 | 5 | 1 | 5 | **25.0** | Add `JsonReportRenderer` + config; unblocks `/explain` |
| Legal-sufficiency disclosure on exports | Assurance §6 | 5 | 1 | 4 | 20.0 | One-liner in `semantic_service.rs` |
| `PolicyLayeredValidator` (§15.7 ledger-gating) | Runtime §15.7 | 5 | 2 | 5 | 12.5 | Replace `PermissiveValidator` with layered impl |
| `RoleBasedAccessControl` (separation-of-duties) | Gov §7.2 / AI §1.5 | 5 | 2 | 5 | 12.5 | Replace `PermissiveAccessControl` |
| Chain-integrity verify endpoint | Kernel §8 | 4 | 1 | 2 | 8.0 | Wrap existing `verify_chain` helper |
| `/instances/:id/explain` handler | Runtime §9 / Gov §3.3 | 5 | 2 | 5 | 12.5 | ~50 lines once `ReportRenderer` is wired + #2 lands |
| Event-idempotency on `POST /events` | Runtime §4.3 | 4 | 2 | 4 | 8.0 | `idempotency_token` on event queue |
| Pipeline validation endpoint | Gov §5.4 | 4 | 3 | 5 | 6.7 | Depends on TODO #38 |
| `IntegrationDispatchService` + correlation tokens | Integ §3, §6 | 4 | 3 | 5 | 6.7 | Replace `EchoExternalService` |
| Policy-parameters as-of resolution | PolicyParam §1.3 | 4 | 2 | 3 | 6.0 | Date-indexed lookup |
| Hold create / release CRUD | Gov §3.6 | 3 | 2 | 3 | 4.5 |  |
| Subject continuity-hash validation | Assurance §3 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 3.0 | Extends existing `/assurance-chain` |
| Calibration expiry enforcement | AI §5.3 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 3.0 | Background job |
| Real drift detection (write-side) | Drift §1.3 | 3 | 5 | 4 | 2.4 | `POST /agents/:id/drift` for external detectors |
| JSON-LD context endpoint | Semantic §3 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 2.0 | Static serve |
| SHACL validation | Semantic §4 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1.3 | Optional feature |
| Counterfactual explanation | Gov §3.4 | 2 | 4 | 2 | 1.0 | Depends on FEL trace |
| Multi-step sessions | Advanced §5 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 2.0 | Defer until consumer demand |
| Migration endpoint | Gov §2.9 | 2 | 3 | 1 | 0.7 | Wrap `WosRuntime::migrate` |
| Real SMT verification | Advanced §6 | 2 | 5 | 1 | 0.4 | External adapter; stub shape durable |
| Agent circuit breakers | Advanced §11 | 2 | 3 | 1 | 0.7 | Defer |
| SPARQL in-server | Semantic §6 | 1 | 5 | 1 | 0.2 | Defer indefinitely |

**Rows dropped from prior ranking:**
- **"Provenance attestation" (was ROI 2.0).** Not a server gap. The `ProvenanceSigner` seam exists in `wos-core::traits`; once wired (top row of new ranking), consumers inject whatever signer they have — Ed25519 local key, HSM, cloud KMS, or the Formspec Respondent Ledger (which provides the cryptographic checkpoint primitive per Formspec S13). The server's responsibility is seam composition, not attestation primitives.

### Top by debt burden (D = 5)

Under the DI framing, every D=5 row is about **seam locks**: the longer a stubbed seam stays stubbed, the more consumers depend on the stub behaviour and the more breaking any tightening becomes.

1. **Wire `ProvenanceSigner` seam (Runtime §12.6).** Every day without a signer wired, the chain lacks externally-verifiable signatures and every consumer builds workarounds (signing provenance exports out-of-band). Cost compounds per consumer.
2. **Wire `ReportRenderer` seam (Runtime §12.7).** Without it, explanation rendering scatters into ad-hoc handlers (the applicant-determination view is one; each new use case grows its own). Wiring the seam early means new use cases plug the existing renderer.
3. **`PolicyLayeredValidator` — §15.7 ledger-gating enforcement.** Runtime §15.7 already obligates that rights-impacting + safety-impacting submits require Respondent Ledger evidence. The server's `PermissiveValidator` accepts anything. Every rights-impacting workflow deployed against the stub violates §15.7 silently. Cost: regulator-defensibility claim collapses.
4. **`RoleBasedAccessControl` — separation-of-duties (Gov §7.2 / AI §1.5).** Permissive behaviour already shipped. Every new consumer builds on "agent can self-review." Tightening later is a breaking change.
5. **Pipeline validation (Gov §5.4).** Without a server-side gate evaluator, handlers hand-roll assertion logic.
6. **Integration correlation (Integ §6).** `ExternalService::invoke` is already in adapters' hands; adding correlation later is a trait-signature break.

### Decision matrix (cross-tabulated)

| Do now (high P, high D, low C) | Do when you can (high P, low D, low C) | Defer — spec change first | Defer indefinitely |
|---|---|---|---|
| Agent separation-of-duties | Legal-sufficiency disclosure | Multi-step sessions (delete) | SPARQL in-server |
| Explanation assembly endpoint | Chain-integrity verify | Agent circuit breakers (delete) | Real SMT verification |
| Pipeline validation endpoint | JSON-LD context | Real drift detection (pivot spec) | |
| Integration correlation tokens | Policy as-of resolution | SHACL validation | |
| Hold CRUD | Subject continuity-hash | | |
| | Calibration expiry | | |

### Recommended sequence

Reordered around **DI seam wiring**: wire the two unwired seams first, then tighten the three stubbed ones, then land the endpoints that ride on them.

**Day 1 — wire the two unwired seams + easy disclosure wins (~3 hr total):**

1. **Wire `ProvenanceSigner` seam** (~1 hr) — add `NoopSigner` with spec-correct `attestation` block shape; add `WOS_SIGNER=noop|ed25519-file|external` config switch; inject into `AppRuntime::build`.
2. **Wire `ReportRenderer` seam** (~1 hr) — add `JsonReportRenderer` default; inject into `AppRuntime::build`.
3. **Legal-sufficiency disclosure on exports** (~30 min) — emit `wosDisclosure` block in PROV-O / XES / OCEL headers per Assurance §6.
4. **Chain-integrity verify endpoint** (~30 min) — wrap existing `verify_chain` helper.

**Day 2 — tighten the three stubbed seams (~1 day total):**

5. **`PolicyLayeredValidator`** (~half day) — replace `PermissiveValidator`. Compose: Formspec contract check (delegate) + Runtime §15.7 ledger-gating policy (`impactLevel ∈ {rights-impacting, safety-impacting}` ⇒ require `respondentLedgerRef` on submit) + #43 signature-class check once spec lands.
6. **`RoleBasedAccessControl`** (~half day) — replace `PermissiveAccessControl`. Separation-of-duties check on review-tagged transitions (reject when actor identity matches reviewed artifact's author); honour delegation chains per Gov §6.

**Day 3 — endpoints that ride on the wired seams (~1 day total):**

7. **`/instances/:id/explain` handler** (~2 hr) — once `ReportRenderer` is wired and the Runtime §9.1 deterministic algorithm (TODO #2) exists, handler is ~50 lines: load provenance + kernel → run algorithm → pass to renderer.
8. **Event-idempotency on `POST /events`** (~2 hr) — accept `idempotencyToken` in body, dedupe via `event_queue`.
9. **Policy-parameters as-of resolution** (~2 hr) — date-indexed lookup.
10. **JSON-LD context endpoint** (~30 min) — static serve.
11. **Subject continuity-hash validation** (~2 hr) — extend `/assurance-chain` response.

**Week 2 — integration-dispatch + auxiliary endpoints (~3 days total):**

12. **`IntegrationDispatchService`** (~1 day) — replace `EchoExternalService`. Dispatch on `IntegrationBindingKind`; wire correlation tokens into the callback registry before more external adapters land (Integ §6).
13. **Pipeline validation endpoint** (~1 day) — depends on TODO #38 `assertionId` resolution landing.
14. **Hold CRUD** (~3 hr).
15. **Calibration expiry enforcement** (~3 hr).
16. **Migration endpoint** (~1 day).

**Post-MVP / demand-gated:**

- **Real drift detection (write-side)** — `POST /agents/:id/drift` for external detectors.
- **Real SMT verification** — swap `NoopSolver` for Z3 when a consumer brings a proof obligation.
- **SHACL validation** — defer until an RDF consumer asks.
- **Multi-step sessions** — defer until consumer demand.
- **Agent circuit breakers** — defer; standalone-agent deployments will need it eventually.
- **Real `Ed25519FileKeySigner`** — the `ProvenanceSigner` seam is wired from Day 1 with `NoopSigner`; ship the Ed25519 reference impl behind a feature flag when a deployment needs externally-verifiable signatures.

**Deferred indefinitely:**

- **SPARQL in-server** — export-to-external is the standard pattern.
- **Counterfactual explanation** — narrow XAI audience; depends on FEL-trace infrastructure that's not warranted yet.

### The compounding costs of deferral (DI seams)

Under the DI framing, the compounding costs cluster around seam state. A stubbed seam is worse than an unwired one: consumers build on the stub's behaviour; retrofitting the real impl then breaks them.

1. **Unwired `ProvenanceSigner` seam.** Every day without a signer wired, consumers either: (a) sign provenance exports out-of-band (incompatible formats across consumers), or (b) skip signing (no externally-verifiable chain). Cost is linear in consumers; each migration to the real seam is a coordination with an external signing provider.

2. **Unwired `ReportRenderer` seam.** Without it, every new use case that needs rendered output (explanation assembly, COC, legal notices, audit certificates) either grows its own ad-hoc handler (fragmentation — the applicant-determination view is already one such) or is blocked. Wiring the seam early turns new use cases into "pass a payload to the injected renderer" one-liners.

3. **Stubbed `PolicyLayeredValidator` (§15.7 ledger-gating).** The spec **already obligates** ledger gating for rights-impacting + safety-impacting workflows. Every such workflow deployed against `PermissiveValidator` is out of conformance silently. The longer this stubs, the more data is accumulated in violation of a MUST.

4. **Stubbed `RoleBasedAccessControl` (separation-of-duties).** Every consumer builds on "agent can self-review." Tightening is a breaking change per consumer.

5. **Stubbed `IntegrationDispatchService` (`EchoExternalService`).** `ExternalService::invoke` signature doesn't model correlation tokens; adapters written against the current shape break on the real impl.

6. **Pipeline assertion scatter.** Without a server-side `validate-pipeline` endpoint, handlers hand-code assertion checks.

The remaining gaps are **additive** — deferring them creates no compounding cost. They're pure feature work that can happen whenever a concrete consumer arrives.

## Notes for future readers

- The "stub" status is load-bearing: consumers can integrate today against spec-correct response shapes. Swapping to real adapters (Z3 for SMT, a real drift detector, a real SHACL engine) doesn't change the wire protocol. Stubs are a feature, not a compromise, for a reference implementation.
- The server intentionally does NOT implement the Lifecycle Detail Companion as HTTP endpoints — it's an internal algorithm reference. Conformance tests cover it.
- Every sidecar that's marked entirely "spec-side" (due-process-config, policy-parameters, assertion-library, agent-config, verification-report, equity-config) is served through the existing `/api/bundles/:url` bundle join. Adding dedicated endpoints would fragment the surface.
