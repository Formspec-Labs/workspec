## Next actionable work items (ordered by ROI)

> Session 4 close 2026-04-18: 7 commits landed (`6409006` wos-synth scaffold, `dfd9189` NoticeTemplate, `62b1561` OverrideRecord, `44ac44c` jurisdiction calendar, `64b03a5` Milestone trigger-mode, `b824927` review-fix, plus session 5 ABL-T pre-pass on `Cargo.lock`). #5 (Imp 9 adverse-decision notice) is now down to one remaining prereq. Working tree clean apart from `MD-INVENTORY.md` (untracked artifact).

1. **§4.1 #24a Mandatory Facts-Tier input snapshot** — last remaining prereq for #5 (Imp 9 adverse-decision notice). Spec amendment + wos-runtime engine change + new conformance rule + ~51 fixture migrations. The single highest-leverage unlock left in §4.1.
2. **§4.1 #2 Deterministic adverse-decision notice (dual-form)** — Imp 9; unlocks once #24a lands. Two of three prereqs (#23 OverrideRecord, NoticeTemplate reconciliation) closed in session 4.
3. **§5.4 Task 7 — synth-trace JSON Schema + drift test** — small follow-up from session 4 wos-synth scaffold; deferred at scaffold time. Closes the "no published schema for the explain artifact" gap noted in semi-formal review Finding 12.
4. **§4.2 #37 Drift Monitor demotion policy binding** — Imp 6 / Cx 3. Started in session 4, paused mid-flight to address review fixes; resumable.
5. **§4.4 Split release trains** — unblocked since §4.2 close. See [plan](thoughts/plans/2026-04-16-wos-release-trains.md).
6. **§5.5 Synthesis benchmark (`wos-bench`)** — unblocked since §5.4 scaffold. See [plan](thoughts/plans/2026-04-16-wos-synthesis-benchmark.md).
7. **v0 spike Tasks 4-5** — conformance gate + retrospective with plan propagation. Still pending from [plan](thoughts/plans/2026-04-17-wos-synth-v0-spike.md).
8. **Remaining §4.1 critical path** — DRAFTS triage (chore that unblocks #20 typed events).

## 2026-04-18 session 4 — wos-synth scaffold + §4.1 chain unblocking (7 commits)

Single-stream session, ROI-prioritized after a "user value, not chores" steer. Six work-product commits + one review-fix commit. Semi-formal review verdict went from REQUEST CHANGES → APPROVE after the fix commit.

### §5.4 wos-synth four-crate scaffold (Plan Tasks 1-6)

`6409006` — created `wos-synth-core` (loop + `Prompter` trait + `ToolContext` trait + prompt templates + `DirectToolContext` stopgap), `wos-synth-mock` (deterministic test prompter), `wos-synth-anthropic` (streaming-callback Anthropic provider), `wos-synth-cli` (binary `wos-synth` with `generate` / `dry-run` / `explain`). DIP invariant: `cargo tree -p wos-synth-core --edges normal | grep -E 'reqwest|tokio|anthropic'` returns empty. End-to-end `dry-run` produces a kernel doc that lints clean without touching the network. Plan Task 7 (synth-trace JSON Schema + drift test) deferred — tracked as next-actionable item #3.

### §4.1 chain — two of three blockers cleared for #5

`dfd9189` — **NoticeTemplate reconciliation.** Dropped the thin `NoticeTemplate` `$def` from `wos-due-process.schema.json`; rich `TemplateSection`-based shape in `wos-notification-template.schema.json` is canonical. Zero in-tree consumers. `noticeTemplateRef` (Governance §3.1) and `notificationTemplateRef` (Governance §12.2) both already routed through the Notification Template sidecar via lint rule G-063. Spec prose updated with redirect note.

`62b1561` — **#23 OverrideRecord schema.** Typed `OverrideRecord` + `EvidenceReference` `$def`s in workflow-governance schema. Three required fields (rationale + authorityVerification + supportingEvidence) map 1:1 to OverrideAuthority policy switches. Authority verification typed via 4-variant method enum (roleAssignment | delegationGrant | supervisorAttestation | externalAuthority). Spec §7.3 prose links to typed shape. Reachable as a "shape catalog" `$def` (intentional unreachability annotated via `$comment`).

### §4.1 + §4.2 discrete user-value items

`44ac44c` — **#31 Jurisdiction-aware business calendar.** Replaced "implementation-defined" calendar selection (§7.1) with deterministic 6-step algorithm via optional `appliesWhen` FEL expression on each Business Calendar. Multi-jurisdiction rights-impacting workflows (one calendar per US state) now have a declarative selection mechanism. Timezone disagreement among applicable calendars is a configuration error — surfaces modelling mistakes at evaluation time.

`64b03a5` — **#29a Milestone trigger-mode spec-lag closure.** Promoted runtime KS.2 behavior into authoring-visible form: `Milestone.triggerMode: writeSettled` (default-only enum, extensible). Spec §4.13 gained "Trigger semantics" paragraph naming the three runtime invariants (fire-after-settled-write, at-most-once-per-instance, lexicographic id ordering). Wos-core `Milestone` struct picked up the optional field. Unblocks #29b reactive milestone firing.

### Semi-formal code review (REQUEST CHANGES → APPROVE)

`b824927` — addressed review findings from sub-agent review of the four scaffold/schema commits. **Blocker (Finding 1)** fixed: `EvidenceReference` schema now has `required: ["kind"]` and `anyOf: [{required: ["caseFieldPath"]}, {required: ["uri"]}]` — the prose contract "evidence MUST be locatable" is structurally enforced. New pytest file `tests/schemas/test_override_record_shape.py` (12 cases) locks both EvidenceReference and OverrideRecord required-field contracts. **Warnings (Findings 2/3/4/5/6/7)** fixed: AnthropicPrompter `Arc::try_unwrap` → `mem::take` (no more discarded paid completions); `strip_fences` no-newline regression repaired with 6 new tests; `LintFinding` extended with `suggested_fix` + `related_docs` plumbed into the repair prompt; ScriptedPrompter/Tools converted to VecDeque + pop_front; trace explain prints "unknown" instead of misleading 0/0/0 token totals; OverrideRecord orphan-`$def` annotated. **Nit (Finding 10)** fixed: `anyhow_lite` rationale documented inline. **Deferred:** Findings 8/9/11/12/13/14 (lower-impact nits and observations).

## 2026-04-18 session 3 — parallel-agent close (~50 commits)

Five concurrent work streams executing simultaneously; all 5 previous "Next actionable items" from session 2 complete. Aggregate: ~50 commits on `main`. Working tree clean at close.

### §5.1 Schema description audit — all tiers at 0 violations

Companions tier (18 violations → 0): 6 commits `4d88dfc` → `3384049` — lifecycle-detail, case-instance top-level, ActiveTask, FormspecTaskContext, ValidationOutcome/Compensation/PendingEvent, GovernanceState/Delegation/Hold/Volume.

Governance tier (159 violations → 0): 4 commits `a9e400b` (assertion-gate, 17 → 0), `a62c30b` (policy-parameters, 23 → 0), `e0d2637` (due-process, 27 → 0), `18e7831` (workflow-governance, 92 → 0).

AI tier (148 violations → 0): 3 commits `595e6f3` (agent-config, 35 → 0), `7339e99` (drift-monitor, 25 → 0), `4d22710` (ai-integration, 88 → 0).

Profiles/sidecars/assurance/advanced (299 violations → 0): 8 commits — `4b530a7` (business-calendar, 14 → 0), `65e3acd` (notification-template, 16 → 0), `61cf062` (assurance, 13 → 0), `bdcb082` (semantic-profile, 28 → 0), `68b07b8` (integration-profile, 48 → 0), `39a7519` (verification-report, 26 → 0), `d42c25c` (equity-config, 32 → 0), `ccd1199` (advanced-governance, 122 → 0).

CI gate: `3493f92` — `schema_doc_zero_regression` test walks `schemas/**/*.schema.json` and fails if any production schema has violations. Covers all 18 production schemas. `wos-mcp-tools.schema.json` was initially excluded, then backfilled (`a87cf30`) and added to the gate. A kernel schema (`wos-correspondence-metadata.schema.json`) had 17 latent violations discovered by the gate and fixed inline.

Reviews: all tiers APPROVED (companions, governance, rest); minor nits all resolved inline.

### §5.3 Trace-emitting conformance — Tasks 4-5 done

Task 4 CLI subcommands `wos-conformance-explain` + `wos-conformance-diff` landed: `842c9ee` (library: trace rendering + diffing) + `09de276` (binaries). Review nits resolved: source_actor comparison added with new `DivergenceCause::ActorMismatch` variant (`103b6af`), whitespace normalized (`de3e848`), binary exit-code contract pinned via `assert_cmd` (`27c4f00`).

Task 5 `schemas/conformance/conformance-trace.schema.json` published (`96c6acf`) with Python pytest validation of all 7 golden traces.

### §4.2 Rule-coverage conformance — Tasks 4-7 done

Task 4 `wos-rule-coverage` coverage library + binary: `6b51bb2` (library) + `ecd4218` (binary). Review nits resolved: `--help` exits 0 (`c5cb23f`), `path_is_referenced` tightened (`b160dee`), `is_expected_traces_path` hardened (`d1d7749`).

Task 5 LINT-MATRIX regen tool landed + matrix regenerated from 197 aspirational rows → 97 code-registry reality: `082fa06` (--generate-matrix flag) + `e2be40a` (matrix regenerated).

Task 6 LoadBearing ≥2-fixture CI gate: `e5eecee`.

Task 7 promotion-candidate discovery + GitHub Actions workflow: `679bcd7`.

### wos-mcp crate — Tasks 3-6 complete (22 tools, round-trip tested)

Task 3 document management: `064099f` (new_kernel() + from_document() factory methods) + `1fdb321` (project registry + document-management tools). Post-review nits: `63c01c3` (dead dep, handler signatures, ai_agent_count TODO, path load test).

Task 4 lifecycle/actor: `fb9cde8` (set_initial_state, add_actor_extension, richer add_state) + `4d66d0a` (lifecycle + actor tools). Post-review: `4bb411c` (self-loop transition count in apply_remove_state), `1e11940` (missing-arg vs. invalid-arg classification in require_*_arg helpers), `92741a0` (advertise Task 4 tools in tools/list discovery for 6 new tools).

Tasks 5-6 governance/AI + validation/query + tool catalog: `3d6cb6c` (governance + AI authoring helpers in wos-authoring), `9a97ecf` (governance + AI tools), `09926aa` (validation + query tools + tool catalog schema), `f1a4537` (round-trip integration test). Post-review blocker: `307d55e` (`dueProcesePaths` → `dueProcessPaths` spec-fidelity rename, touched 7 files across wos-authoring + wos-mcp), plus `a23ddd1` (Engine error classification as Internal not InvalidArguments), `11065f6` (remove dead unwrap_or in wos_search constraint branch), `681cf21` (useless_format clippy warning + test intent clarification).

Final state: 22 tools, round-trip test at `crates/wos-mcp/tests/round_trip.rs`, tool catalog schema `schemas/mcp/wos-mcp-tools.schema.json` at 0 SCHEMA-DOC-001 violations.

### §5.2 Structured lint diagnostics — Tasks 3-6 done

Task 3 rule migration (largest task): 92 unique rule IDs / 110 push sites migrated across `tier1.rs` (41 rules), `tier2.rs` (38 rules), `fel_analysis.rs` (12 rules), `schema_doc.rs` (1 rule). Commits: `0a25e4b` (Tier 1 migration), `d635a6d` (Tier 2 migration), `262ed7a` (FEL analysis migration), `220bee6` (SCHEMA-DOC-001 migration).

Task 4 output formatters (text / JSON / SARIF 2.1.0): `ab89dae` landed the `LintDiagnostic` constructors + text/json/sarif formatters alongside §5.2 Tasks 2-4; the session 3 rule migration (below) consumed them.

Task 5 `schemas/lint/wos-lint-diagnostic.schema.json` published: `d2a3fc1`.

Task 6 `crates/wos-lint/MIGRATION.md` migration guide: `5be48b8`.

Plan status updated: `03d9768`.

## 2026-04-18 session 2 — code review of 2026-04-17/18 parallel-agent batch (6 APPROVE, 1 REQUEST CHANGES → resolved)

Seven parallel semi-formal code reviews on the 14-commit batch delivered by 7 sonnet sub-agents executing v0 scopes of wos-authoring / wos-mcp / wos-synth-spike / §4.2 Task 2 / §5.1 Task 2 / §5.2 Tasks 1-2 / §5.3 Tasks 2-3. **Aggregate: 6 of 7 REQUEST CHANGES, 1 APPROVE (§5.1 triage).** Five real blockers across three work units, plus supporting warnings.

### Blockers (ordered by damage if not fixed)

> **Status (session 2 close, 2026-04-18):** ALL FIVE blockers cleared + post-review follow-ups + cleanup-review nits landed. §5.3 teaching signal end-to-end. Verdict on the follow-up review: APPROVE.

**Blockers cleared**

- **Blocker 1 — §5.3 teaching signal** (`b0b9ac5` + `95b88e9` + `b28f610` + `120086e`, follow-up `742373c`). Evaluator now captures `GuardEvaluation` records (including short-circuited false guards); `DrainOnceResult.guard_evaluations` plumbs them through runtime; `TraceStep.guards_evaluated` populated per step; `Delta::GuardFalse` enriched when an expected transition's guard blocks; `TraceStep.policies_applied` synthesized from governance/AI provenance via canonical `ProvenanceKind::is_policy_application()`. Single source of truth: `wos-conformance::trace::GuardEvaluation` re-exports `wos_core::eval::GuardEvaluation` (with `source_state` / `target_state` / `event` fields added to carry the teaching signal). Seven goldens regenerated (additive).
- **Blocker 2 — §5.2 `SuggestedFix::Custom` panic** (`0f6f049`, plan synced `935dce9`). Tuple variant `Custom(String)` converted to struct variant `Custom { hint: String }` with serde round-trip test.
- **Blocker 3 — wos-authoring `Command` visibility** (`9470b14` + `a42c281`). Enum sealed `pub(crate)`; `lib.rs` re-export dropped; `dispatch` moved onto inherent `pub(crate)` method of `RawWosProject`; `AppliedCommand::inverse` / `with_inverse` tightened. `cargo check -p wos-authoring --tests` warning-clean. Closes the prior session-review Finding 1.
- **Blocker 4 — wos-authoring plan used fictitious enum variants.** Plan realigned to real `ActorKind = Human | System` (AI agents route through `x-wos-ai.agents`; custom kinds through §10.6 `actorExtension` seam) and real `ImpactLevel = RightsImpacting | SafetyImpacting | Operational | Informational`.
- **Blocker 5 — §5.3 T3 fixture data-path mismatch** (6 happy-path fixtures across two passes: `0f7e27b` + `0b61e96` + `ddd25d3` + `56369bf`). (a) `initial_case_state` bridges added so guards evaluate; (b) `expected_provenance` migrated from legacy `type`/`from`/`to` to serde `recordKind`/`fromState`/`toState`; K-046 + G-030 `expected_transitions` expanded to full sequences. All six happy-path goldens now `outcome: pass` with honest step counts (1, 5, 2, 1, 7, 12); K-001 correctly stays `fail/0` as a negative lint fixture. Six new `happy_path_*` tests assert runtime engagement + `outcome=Pass`.

**Follow-up fixes from the post-blocker review cycles**

- **`742373c` — §5.3 semi-formal-review fixes.** (a) `policies_applied` was silently empty on real fixtures because governance constructors set `event: None` and the trace extractor filtered on event match; runtime `drain_once` now stamps the drain's event onto policy-kind records. (b) Policy-id extractor widened from `ruleId`/`policyId` to also include `constraintId` (what governance actually emits), `id`, `tool`, with camelCase-kind fallback for aggregate records (DeonticResolution etc.). (c) `Delta::GuardFalse` carries `expression` for disambiguation when two transitions share `(from, target, event)`. (d) `build_guard_inputs` handles `[*]` wildcard paths (guards using `every()` / `some()`). (e) Stale "opaque wos_runtime" docstring replaced. (f) `DrainOnceResult` struct-literal uses `..Default::default()`. Four new tests including end-to-end AI-014 governance fixture that would have been red before the stamping fix.
- **`ef0da3c` — cleanup-review nits.** `wos-lint::document` got the TODO comment that `wos-synth-spike::loop_mod::MISSING_MARKER_SENTINEL` references. `wos-mcp/src/server.rs` header no longer asserts rust-mcp-sdk is "too heavy" — points at the `Cargo.toml` TODO with the corrected feature-flag analysis.
- **`b203c29` + `6e83cdf` — §4.2 Task 3 CI ratchet.** `every_promoted_*_rule_has_executable_or_annotated_evidence` test added to both `crates/wos-conformance/tests/rule_registry.rs` and `crates/wos-lint/tests/rule_registry.rs`: every `Tested`/`LoadBearing` entry requires a resolvable executable fixture OR an evidence-annotation comment (mirroring AI-004 / AI-050 / K-EXT-002 / G-052 pattern). AI-041 evidence annotation added as a TDD discovery.

**What this unblocks**

- §5.4 repair prompts now have a real teaching signal (guards + policies are populated end-to-end).
- §4.2 `Tested` → `LoadBearing` promotions are now CI-gated.
- wos-mcp Tasks 3-6 can safely depend on the sealed `WosProject` façade.

### Session 2 warnings — all resolved in session 3

All warnings from the original review (wos-mcp JSON-RPC hygiene, v0 spike model + error classification, §4.2 fixture-link evidence gaps, §5.2 LintDiagnostic latent issues) were addressed before session 3 close. See the "New work items added by this review" list below for resolution commits.

### Non-blocker observations worth knowing

- **§5.1 triage** (`1e37b56`) — APPROVE. Minor factual corrections (K-023 is a crash-recovery conformance test, not a url lint rule; `$schema` descriptions vary more than "all missing or 47-char" claimed; 20 kernel fixtures reference `url` not 14; `title` count 15 not 16). Classifications are defensible; reshape wins validated (ExtensionsMap x30, JsonSchemaUri x18, bare items x39).
- Pre-bump of workspace `Cargo.toml` (commit `b5cb7e2`) successfully prevented the parallel-dispatch race the practices doc was written for. Validated discipline.

### New work items added by this review

- ✅ **§5.3 runtime instrumentation** — landed `b0b9ac5` + `95b88e9` + `b28f610` + `120086e` + follow-up fix `742373c`. DrainOnceResult.guard_evaluations carries GuardEvaluation records from the evaluator; build_trace_from_result populates TraceStep.guards_evaluated per-step and enriches Delta::GuardFalse (with `expression`) when an expected transition's guard evaluated false. PolicyApplication synthesized from governance/AI provenance records via the canonical `ProvenanceKind::is_policy_application()` method in wos-core; policy-id lookup covers `ruleId`/`policyId`/`constraintId`/`id`/`tool` with camelCase-kind fallback. Wildcard path dependencies (`[*]`) handled. Seven T3 goldens regenerated (additive only). §5.4 repair prompts now have a real teaching signal end-to-end.
- ✅ **§5.3 fixture repair** — resolved in session 2 (six happy-path T3 fixtures repaired with `initial_case_state` seeding + `expected_provenance` shape migration; see session-1 summary above).
- ✅ **§5.2 `Custom` variant fix** — landed `0f6f049`, plan sketch updated `935dce9`.
- ✅ **wos-authoring pre-Task-4 fixes** — `Command` sealed `pub(crate)` (`9470b14` + `a42c281`); plan realigned to real `Human | System` ActorKind and `RightsImpacting | SafetyImpacting | Operational | Informational` ImpactLevel.
- ✅ **wos-mcp hygiene pass** — 6 commits `bf86853` + `d6377ce` + `732f848` + `68f5d26` + `5394d15` + `e1530d9`: notifications, JSON-RPC error codes, dead `ServerError` removed, test timeout, handler signature aligned, rust-mcp-sdk TODO with feature-flag analysis. Review-approved with 2 doc nits (fixed `ef0da3c`).
- ✅ **v0 spike warning fixes** — 3 commits `47677fa` + `e165dd7` + `add6796`: claude-sonnet-4-6 model bump; `SpikeError::MissingWosMarker` / `LintFailure` distinct variants; API-key guard rejects empty / whitespace-only. 15/15 tests green. Review-approved.
- ✅ **§4.2 registry annotations** — 3 commits `d86f3df` + `f96f6c5` + `91602de`: K-EXT-002 (wos-lint tier2 inline evidence); AI-001 / AI-002 (indirect fixture linkage via batch number); G-052 (expanded to exhaustive 20-fixture listing). Review-approved.
- ✅ **§4.2 Task 3 CI ratchet** — 2 commits `b203c29` + `6e83cdf`: `every_promoted_*_rule_has_executable_or_annotated_evidence` in both conformance and lint registry tests; AI-041 annotation added as a TDD discovery.
- ✅ **COMP-001 companion drift lint rule blocker cleared** — §5.2 Task 3 rule migration landed in session 3; COMP-001 is now unblocked for implementation.

---

Plan closed `03d9768`. COMP-001 companion drift lint rule now unblocked.
- ✅ **§5.3 Trace-emitting conformance** — [plan](thoughts/plans/2026-04-16-wos-trace-emitting-conformance.md). All 5 tasks done. **Tasks 1-3** (ConformanceTrace type + runner emission + golden traces) `bb1d323` → `d961c9f` → fixture repair → `b0b9ac5` + `95b88e9` + `b28f610` + `120086e` + `742373c`. Teaching signal fully operational: `guards_evaluated` + `policies_applied` populated; `Delta::GuardFalse` carries `guard_id` + `expression` + `inputs`. **Task 4** CLI subcommands `842c9ee` (library) + `09de276` (binaries) + `103b6af` (ActorMismatch) + `de3e848` (whitespace) + `27c4f00` (exit-code contract). **Task 5** conformance-trace schema `96c6acf`. §5.4 repair prompts can consume the full teaching signal end-to-end.
- ✅ **`wos-authoring` crate MVP** — [plan](thoughts/plans/2026-04-17-wos-authoring-crate.md). **All 8 Tasks landed.** Tasks 1-3 (`a33094d` + `f9c879c` + `daec5b8`) + sealing (`9470b14` + `a42c281`) + Tasks 4-8 (12 commits `0a124ca` → `46fc45a`) + review nits (`d46e26c`). Final state: 13-variant `pub(crate)` Command enum; 10 handlers (AddState/AddTransition/AddActor/RemoveActor/SetImpactLevel/AddContract/AddExtensionKey/AddActorDeontic/SetTimer/RenameState/AddMilestone/RemoveMilestone); snapshot-based undo/redo with `UNDO_DEPTH = 100` eviction cap (tested); public `WosProject` façade over private `RawWosProject`; README; end-to-end integration test covering guarded fork + multi-domain compose + undo/redo interleave + save→load roundtrip. 49 unit + 1 integration tests; `cargo check --tests` warning-clean. Public surface: only `WosProject`, `AuthoringResult`, `AuthoringDiagnostic`, `Severity`, and re-exported kernel enums. Review verdict APPROVE WITH NITS — F1-F4 (pub(crate) sealing, UNDO_DEPTH test, comment correction, plan milestone backfill) fixed in `d46e26c`. Unblocks wos-mcp Task 3 (can now safely depend on `WosProject`) and §5.4 synth-core.
- ✅ **`wos-mcp` crate** — [plan](thoughts/plans/2026-04-17-wos-mcp-crate.md). All 6 tasks done. 22 tools, round-trip test at `crates/wos-mcp/tests/round_trip.rs`. **Tasks 1-2** `cde0b04` + `53eb25f` + hygiene pass `bf86853` + `d6377ce` + `732f848` + `68f5d26` + `5394d15` + `e1530d9` + `ef0da3c`. **Task 3** `064099f` + `1fdb321` + nits `63c01c3`. **Task 4** `fb9cde8` + `4d66d0a` + fixes `4bb411c` + `1e11940` + `92741a0`. **Tasks 5-6** `3d6cb6c` + `9a97ecf` + `09926aa` + `f1a4537` + post-review `307d55e` (spec-fidelity rename) + `a23ddd1` + `11065f6` + `681cf21`. Tool catalog schema `schemas/mcp/wos-mcp-tools.schema.json` at 0 violations.
- 🟡 **§5.4 `wos-synth-core` + providers** — [plan](thoughts/plans/2026-04-16-wos-synth-crate.md). **Plan Tasks 1-6 landed `6409006` (session 4):** four-crate split (`wos-synth-core` + `-mock` + `-anthropic` + `-cli`); DIP invariant verified empty `cargo tree -p wos-synth-core --edges normal | grep -E 'reqwest|tokio|anthropic'`; 12+3+2 tests; CLI `dry-run` lints clean end-to-end without network. **Review fixes** `b824927`: EvidenceReference blocker (governance schema) + AnthropicPrompter Arc::try_unwrap fragility + strip_fences no-newline regression + lint suggested_fix/related_docs plumbing + VecDeque test pattern + token-count "unknown" display. **Task 7 deferred** — synth-trace JSON Schema + drift test; tracked as next-actionable #3.
- 🔴 **§5.5 Synthesis benchmark (`wos-bench`)** — [plan](thoughts/plans/2026-04-16-wos-synthesis-benchmark.md). Depends on wos-synth-core.
- ✅ **§4.1 NoticeTemplate reconciliation** — `dfd9189` (session 4). Dropped thin `NoticeTemplate` `$def` from due-process schema; rich Notification Template sidecar canonical. Zero in-tree consumers; lint G-063 already routed both refs through the sidecar.
- ✅ **§4.1 #23 OverrideRecord schema** — `62b1561` (session 4). Typed `OverrideRecord` + `EvidenceReference` `$def`s in workflow-governance with 1:1 mapping to OverrideAuthority policy switches. Authority-verification typed via 4-variant method enum. Spec §7.3 prose links to typed shape. Pytest contract `tests/schemas/test_override_record_shape.py` (12 cases) added in `b824927` to lock the EvidenceReference locator + OverrideRecord required-field invariants.
- ✅ **§4.1 #31 Jurisdiction-aware business calendar** — `44ac44c` (session 4). Replaced "implementation-defined" §7.1 selection with deterministic 6-step algorithm via optional `appliesWhen` FEL on each Business Calendar. Multi-jurisdiction rights-impacting workflows now have a declarative selection mechanism. Timezone disagreement among applicable calendars raises a configuration error.
- ✅ **§4.2 #29a Milestone trigger-mode spec-lag closure** — `64b03a5` (session 4). `Milestone.triggerMode: writeSettled` (default-only enum) names the runtime KS.2 behavior. Spec §4.13 gained "Trigger semantics" paragraph naming fire-after-settled-write + at-most-once-per-instance + lexicographic id ordering. Wos-core struct picks up the optional field (roundtrip safe). Unblocks #29b reactive milestone firing.
- ✅ **§5.6 Repositioning docs** — README + POSITIONING lead with Claim A / Claim B framing.
- ✅ **§8 Open questions** — all 6 resolved 2026-04-17; doc archived at `thoughts/archive/reviews/2026-04-16-architecture-review-open-questions.md`.
- ✅ **Schema regression tests** — [plan](thoughts/plans/2026-04-17-wos-schema-regression-tests.md). 6 commits (`793e2e8` through `59bf25b`); 72 pytest cases pass, 2 skip, 1 xfail. Meta-validity + fixture validity + spec-example validity + negative fixtures + CI gate.
- 🟡 **v0 spike** — [plan](thoughts/plans/2026-04-17-wos-synth-v0-spike.md). **Tasks 1-3** landed `26c7eaa` + `d2bb234` + `58fb369`: 529 LOC across 4 files (under 800 cap), lint-driven repair loop, 9 unit tests green. **All 3 warnings fixed 2026-04-18**: model bumped to `claude-sonnet-4-6` (`47677fa`); `SpikeError::MissingWosMarker` / `LintFailure` distinct variants with classifier tests (`e165dd7`); API-key guard rejects empty / whitespace-only (`add6796`); upstream `wos-lint::document` got a TODO pointing at the sentinel-substring fragility (`ef0da3c`). 15/15 tests green. **Tasks 4-5 pending**: conformance gate + retrospective with plan propagation.

## 1 — Reference implementation blockers

> §1 closed 2026-04-14 — see [COMPLETED.md](COMPLETED.md).

---

## 2 — Foundational (zero external dependencies)

- [x] **Provenance export** — Serialize internal provenance to W3C PROV-O, OCEL 2.0, IEEE 1849 XES. Landed 2026-04-15 — see [COMPLETED.md § Provenance export](COMPLETED.md#provenance-export-pe).
- [ ] **Ontology field identity** *(design not started — do not sequence as active work)* — `ontology-spec.md` does not exist. Informs AI integration, cross-document alignment, and regulatory specs in §6, but cannot be scheduled until the spec is drafted. Prerequisite design work: JSON-LD `@context` decision (see Deferred #9), semantic-field-identity protocol, cross-document alignment mechanism. Move to active only once a draft exists.

---

## 3 — Engine adapters (open question — sequencing unresolved)

> **Status:** sequencing unresolved. TODO previously placed engine adapters as a near-term priority; IDEA_SCRATCH #49 marked them Defer with trigger "first commercial deployment requesting a specific adapter." No arbitrating document. Items kept in the backlog below but **not** scheduled until this question is resolved.

- [ ] **#49 Camunda 8 Worker** `[Imp 5 / Cx 8 / Debt 3]` — Delegate BPMN task execution under WOS governance. Most common BPMN target; broadest external fixture diversity.
- [ ] **#49 Temporal Workflow** `[Imp 5 / Cx 8 / Debt 3]` — Map WOS evaluation steps to deterministic replay. Natural fit with WOS evaluator determinism.
- [ ] **#49 AWS Step Functions** `[Imp 5 / Cx 8 / Debt 3]` — Bridge ASL states to WOS transitions. Broadest commercial reach; narrowest semantic fit.

---

## 4 — Active backlog (priority-ordered)

Previously split across "schema closures" and "behavioral specs." Collapsed and re-sorted 2026-04-16 by cost-to-defer + first-adopter enablement.

### Priority logic and scoring rubric

**Priority logic (2026-04-16 re-sort).** Two goals drive order: (A) reduce architectural lock-in while it's still cheap, (B) make WOS immediately usable by a first real adopter. Items are ranked by cost-to-defer, not cost-to-do. Cheap-and-cheap-forever items are bundled separately so they don't crowd the critical path. The prior Urgency formula from IDEA_SCRATCH (`(Imp+Debt)/Cx`) is retired — it over-rewarded low-Cx regression-prevention items. Scores `[Imp/Cx/Debt]` are preserved per item as metadata — they inform relative weight within each tier but do not override cross-tier ordering.

**Score definitions (0–10 scale):**

- **Imp** — **Importance.** How much does this item move the project forward (architectural leverage, first-adopter enablement, civil-rights/compliance weight). Higher = do it.
- **Cx** — **Complexity.** How much real work (design + implementation + test) this takes. Higher = bigger lift.
- **Debt** — **Architectural tech debt if deferred.** How much extra rework lands later if we don't do it now. Higher = cheaper now than later. Confined-scope fixes score low; load-bearing foundational items (0/N fixtures, unclosed escape hatches) score high.

**Score validation (2026-04-16).** Scores audited in parallel by four code-scout agents against live schemas, specs, crates, and fixtures. Adjustments applied: DRAFTS Debt 7→5, #24a Cx 3→4, #20 Cx 6→7, #46 Cx 2→3, #39 Cx 2→1, #12 Cx 2→3, #56 Debt 3→2, #35 Debt 5→4, #40 Debt 5→4, #30 Cx 4→5, #28 Debt 3→2, Assertion-Library merge Cx 3→2, #22 Cx 6→4, #48 Debt 4→6, #51 Debt 3→5. Factual corrections applied to #22 (runtime.rs lives in wos-runtime at 4451 lines, not wos-core at 3821; binding-inversion already landed), #28 (inputDigest/outputDigest already wired through export crate, not prose-only), #56 (continuous_reevaluate has 4 in-crate test callers, not "dead code").

### 4.1 — Critical path (lock-in + usable)

Items that get materially more expensive if deferred, or that block a first real adopter. Do these first.

- [ ] **DRAFTS triage** `[Imp 5 / Cx 3 / Debt 5]` *(prerequisite — not an IDEA item)* — `DRAFTS/` contains 12 kernel version proposals (v2–v7 + competing v7 drafts). Classify archive / delete / extract. **Blocks #20.** Must complete before any schema/spec PR touching the kernel lands. Files are inert markdown (not referenced from schemas/crates), so Debt is a review-time tax rather than structural lock-in.
- [ ] **#24a Mandatory Facts-Tier input snapshot** `[Imp 8 / Cx 4 / Debt 7]` — Tighten Facts Tier §8.2: case-file input snapshot MANDATORY and typed at `determination`-tagged transitions. 0 conformance fixtures populate `inputs` today; retrofit touches ~51 determination-tagged fixtures (out of 157), plus schema tightening and new conformance rule. Cheap now, expensive once fixtures accumulate. Silent dependency of #2. Unblocks #23.
- [x] **#23 OverrideRecord schema** — landed `62b1561` (session 4); see Current plan status. Pytest contract added `b824927`.
- [x] **NoticeTemplate reconciliation** — landed `dfd9189` (session 4); see Current plan status.
- [ ] **#2 Deterministic adverse-decision notice (dual-form)** `[Imp 9 / Cx 7 / Debt 6]` — Specified deterministic algorithm (not model-generated) deriving two co-synchronized outputs from the same Facts + Reasoning provenance: a machine-readable artifact (structured, citable, diffable under audit) and a human-prose artifact (plain language, suitable for legal service). Identical inputs MUST produce identical outputs in both forms. Sits at Governance §3.2 — explicitly separated from the non-authoritative Narrative tier (AI Integration §13). Delivery mechanism = Notification Template §4.4 (FEL-conditional sections + `requiredVariables` enforcement). Scaffolding today: `AdverseDecisionPolicy` typed but permissive; `NoticeSent` is a hardcoded stub (`event_handler.rs:72-81`); zero runtime rendering code. Remaining work: deterministic assembly algorithm + rendering pipeline + determinism fixtures. **Dependencies:** #24a (only remaining prereq — #23 + NoticeTemplate cleared in session 4).
- [ ] **#20 Typed event meta-vocabulary** `[Imp 8 / Cx 7 / Debt 6]` — Replace `Transition.event: string` with strict 5-kind typed union `{ kind: "timer" | "message" | "signal" | "condition" | "error", ... }`. No `named` wrapper; no escape hatch. Co-type `Action.event` for `startTimer`. Closes kernel's last load-bearing openness. Migration surface is ~168 fixtures containing `"event":` strings (much larger than originally framed); plus schema + Rust model + K-007 lint promotion to schema validation. **Depends on DRAFTS triage.**
- [x] **#31 Jurisdiction-aware business calendar selection** — landed `44ac44c` (session 4); see Current plan status.

### 4.2 — Next (unblocks once §4.1 lands)

- [ ] **#22a ProvenanceKind tier-typing** `[Imp 4 / Cx 4 / Debt 3]` *(extracted from #22; re-scored 2026-04-16 post-PE.2)* — Replace the 93-variant `ProvenanceKind` monolith enum (`crates/wos-core/src/provenance.rs`) with a tier-typed record (kernel / governance / ai / advanced). **Debt lowered 5→3:** PE.2 added the `audit_layer` field and an exhaustive `audit_layer_for_kind` match, so new variants must now explicitly declare their tier at compile time — the "ossification" pressure is partly relieved. Remaining value is data-shape cleanliness: separating record payloads by tier so each tier's struct carries only the fields it can populate. Still load-bearing for the broader #22 crate split but no longer urgent. The rest of #22 (directory split, runtime.rs split, CI fence) remains organizational and stays in §4.6.
- [ ] **#46 Schema-prose enum alignment batch** `[Imp 4 / Cx 3 / Debt 3]` — Close to enum: `CaseRelationship.type`, `HoldPolicy.holdType` (reconcile §12.2 / §7.15 / schema three-way disagreement on `legal-hold`), `AppealMechanism.reviewerConstraint` (required + enum incl. `independentFromOriginal`), `AppealMechanism.continuationScope`. Add FEL context citation to `DelegationScope.conditions`. ISO 8601 duration patterns. Add missing Drift Monitor `AlertThreshold` prose table. Domain-specific values route through #21 registry.
- [ ] **#21 Extension registry (seams-only MVP)** `[Imp 5 / Cx 4 / Debt 3]` — `schemas/registry/wos-extension-registry.schema.json` + `specs/registry/extension-registry.md`. Catalog the six kernel seams (§10) + Trellis custody shape. Lifecycle (draft → stable → deprecated → retired), composition semantics, discovery. Catalogs relocations from #46 and closes `custodyHook` escape.
- [x] **#29a Milestone spec-lag closure** — landed `64b03a5` (session 4); see Current plan status. Unblocks #29b.
- [ ] **#37 Drift Monitor demotion policy binding** `[Imp 6 / Cx 3 / Debt 5]` — Normative binding from `alertThresholds[].action` to `DemotionRule`. Candidate: `alertThresholds[].policyRef`. Promoted to standalone after M-1 merge blocked.
- [ ] **#39 ContinuationPolicy normative linkage** `[Imp 4 / Cx 1 / Debt 3]` — Specify how `AppealMechanism.continuationOfServices: true` resolves to a specific `ContinuationPolicy`. `ContinuationPolicy` `$def` already exists (`wos-due-process.schema.json:160`) and `continuationOfServices: boolean` already exists (`wos-workflow-governance.schema.json:324`); work is one `continuationPolicyRef` string + brief resolution prose. Promoted to standalone after M-2 rejected.

### 4.3 — Cheap batch (ship together in one sprint)

Low-cost, low-risk, no lock-in. Independent of critical-path work — can land in parallel. Ordering within the batch doesn't matter.

- [ ] **#34 `x-lm.critical` enforcement gate** `[Imp 6 / Cx 1 / Debt 2]` — CI rule (`docs:check`) rejecting schema PRs where `x-lm.critical: true` nodes lack `description` or `examples`. 131 critical nodes; 0 current violations.
- [ ] **#57 Assurance schema `x-lm.critical` coverage** `[Imp 3 / Cx 1 / Debt 2]` — Add annotations to key nodes in `schemas/assurance/wos-assurance.schema.json`. Only schema in the suite without any.
- [ ] **#13 Verifiability test principle** `[Imp 4 / Cx 1 / Debt 1]` — Doc-only. Kernel §1.2 design-goal bullet + cross-refs in Governance §6.1 and AI Integration §1.2.
- [ ] **#12 Capability preconditions** `[Imp 6 / Cx 3 / Debt 4]` — `preconditions` array on agent capabilities; FEL expressions evaluated before invocation. Unsatisfied → skip, fall through to fallback chain.
- [ ] **#56 Runtime §2 isolation-invariant lint rule** `[Imp 5 / Cx 2 / Debt 2]` — Static AST lint detecting `setData` → guard dependency cycles in `continuous`-mode documents. `continuous_reevaluate` is defined at `crates/wos-core/src/eval_mode.rs:55` with 4 in-crate test callers (not dead code, as earlier framing claimed); lint prevents future defective documents from shipping.
- [ ] **#42 Autonomy-lifecycle conformance fixture batch** `[Imp 5 / Cx 2 / Debt 2]` — Two fixtures: (1) escalation-expiry revocation; (2) drift-alert-triggered demotion. Already covered: calibration-expiry (AC-001), humanOverride-triggered demotion (ai-028/ai-029).

### 4.4 — Behavioral backlog (after §4.1–§4.3 stabilize)

Specifies processor behavior, governance semantics, or runtime obligations. Not usability-critical, not foundational lock-in — schedule once the critical path and cheap batch have landed. Dependencies noted where they exist.

- [ ] **#26a `AccessControl.canRead` enforcement semantics** `[Imp 6 / Cx 3 / Debt 4]` — Specify normative processor behavior on `canRead(actorId, fieldPath) → false`: redact / return `null` / raise error / skip action. Conformance fixtures per branch. Interface exists as pure stub today (defaults `true`, zero call sites). **Prerequisite to #26b.**
- [ ] **#26b `caseFieldPolicy` schema** `[Imp 6 / Cx 6 / Debt 4]` — `caseFieldPolicy` `$def` in workflow-governance schema; per-field read/write scopes by actor role. Governance-layer.
- [ ] **#36 Equity RemediationTrigger expression language** `[Imp 6 / Cx 4 / Debt 4]` — FEL extension vs. restricted DSL vs. FEL + windowing. **Prerequisite to #35.**
- [ ] **#35 Equity Config enforcement semantics** `[Imp 7 / Cx 5 / Debt 4]` — Specify processor obligations for `RemediationTrigger.action`; wire `DisparityMethod` to runtime per `ReportingSchedule`; define "suspended workflow" behaviorally. Applies to human AND AI decisions. Runtime seam partially in place (`ProvenanceKind::EquityAlert`, lifecycle emission in `event_handler.rs`); behavioral enforcement still absent.
- [ ] **#24b + #25 joint design** *(rule-firing trace + defeasibility)* `[#24b: 7/6/4 · #25: 6/7/6]` — Reasoning Tier gains ordered rule list, intermediate state, outcome; Catala-style default logic with declared rule priorities. Load-bearing coupling — evaluation order requires defeasibility answer. Must compose with `sourceAuthority` rank (§6.2) and Integration Profile §11.2 ("restrict, never relax").
- [ ] **#43 Assurance × impact-level composition rule** `[Imp 6 / Cx 5 / Debt 4]` — Specify whether a minimum Assurance level is required for AI-assisted determinations at `rights-impacting` impact. Respect Invariant 6.
- [ ] **#38 Assertion Library cross-document reference protocol** `[Imp 5 / Cx 3 / Debt 3]` — `assertionId` on `PipelineStage.assertions[]`; resolution semantics. The library concept exists in prose; the reference mechanism doesn't.
- [ ] **#40 Task SLA authoring surface** `[Imp 6 / Cx 5 / Debt 4]` — Add schema properties for §10.3 normative prose (`slaDefinitions`, `warningThresholds`, `breachPolicy`, `escalationChain`). Currently spec'd as normative processor behavior with no schema surface. Adjacent scaffolding exists (`sla-warning` category in notification-template schema; SLA-aware business calendar schema), which reduces retrofit cost if deferred.
- [ ] **#30 WS-HumanTask lifecycle completion** `[Imp 5 / Cx 5 / Debt 2]` — Extend 8-state model: task-level `Suspended`, distinct `Cancelled` terminal, explicit `Return` with rework counter, group-forwarding distinct from person-delegation.
- [ ] **#27 Cancellation regions** `[Imp 4 / Cx 6 / Debt 3]` — YAWL-style named region spanning arbitrary structural levels, fireable as a unit. Distinct from existing `cancellationPolicy` join policy.
- [ ] **#28 Claim-check artifact references** `[Imp 4 / Cx 4 / Debt 2]` — Typed `ExternalArtifactRef { uri, contentHash, hashAlgorithm, mediaType }` as case-field value with normative integrity-check at retrieval. `inputDigest`/`outputDigest` fields are already wired through `ProvenanceRecord` and the export crate (`wos-export/src/{ocel,xes,prov_o}.rs`); remaining work is the `ExternalArtifactRef` type and population/retrieval contract.
- [ ] **#29b Milestone reactive transition firing (GSM-style)** `[Imp 6 / Cx 5 / Debt 2]` — `MilestoneFired` enqueues event, or `$milestone.*` FEL boolean for guards. Ships after #29a.
- [ ] **#3 Policy-based migration routing** `[Imp 5 / Cx 6 / Debt 2]` — `migrationPolicy` enum: `grandfather | migrateAll | migrateByState | expression`. Composes with Governance §2.9. **Open sub-questions:** `tenant`-scope behavioral contract undefined (0 code matches); version pinning on provenance records.

### 4.5 — Structural merges (schema consolidation)

Absorbed from IDEA_SCRATCH. Schedule alongside whichever critical-path item naturally touches them.

- [ ] **Assertion Library → Workflow Governance** `[Imp 4 / Cx 2 / Debt 3]` — Absorb as "Named Assertions" section. Library without #38 reference protocol is incomplete; absorb rather than fix. Source is a thin 55-line spec + 139-line schema; merge is mechanical.
- [ ] **Verification Report → Advanced Governance** `[Imp 3 / Cx 2 / Debt 2]` — Absorb as "Output Artifacts" section. Thin sidecar.
- [ ] **Due Process Config partial merge → Workflow Governance** `[Imp 5 / Cx 3 / Debt 4]` (pending #45 step 0) — If thin NoticeTemplate drops (per #2) and AppealRouting + ContinuationPolicy remain, the merge closes the `ContinuationPolicy` ↔ `AppealMechanism.continuationOfServices` linkage gap structurally.
- **M-1 Drift Monitor + Agent Config — BLOCKED.** Merge blocked by `fixtures/ai/benefits-drift-monitor.json` shipping standalone. Ship #37 standalone binding instead; reconsider merge if fixture is revised.
- **M-2 Notification Template + Due Process Config — REJECTED.** 4 non-due-process categories. Ship #39 standalone linkage instead.

### 4.6 — Engineering hygiene (deprioritized)

Organizational debt, not architectural. First adopter won't notice. Schedule when the relevant code is actively being touched for another reason.

- [ ] **#22 Crate split along tier boundaries** `[Imp 5 / Cx 3 / Debt 3]` *(ProvenanceKind tier-typing extracted to §4.2 as #22a)* — Split `wos-core` → `wos-kernel | wos-governance | wos-ai | wos-advanced`. Split `wos-runtime/src/runtime.rs` (now 4451 lines, up from 3821) along action-kind dispatch. Add CI dependency fence. Remaining scope is purely organizational; first adopter won't notice. **Note:** `wos-formspec-binding → wos-runtime` inversion is already landed (`wos-formspec-binding/Cargo.toml:10-13`); `runtime.rs` lives in `wos-runtime`, not `wos-core`.
- [ ] **#45 Sidecar normative-contract audit** `[Imp 6 / Cx 5 / Debt 5]` — Retrofit all sidecars against CONVENTIONS.md: Step 0 (does this sidecar deserve independent existence?) + three-question rubric (Structure / Semantics / Composition).

---

## 5 — Audit and evidence products

Build on the stable provenance export surface from §2. Schedule after §4.1 lands.

- [ ] **#48 Merkle provenance chains** `[Imp 6 / Cx 6 / Debt 6]` — Cryptographic hash-chaining for tamper-evident logs. Attaches via Assurance `provenanceLayer` seam. Hash-chaining only initially; full SCITT / RFC 9162 transparency-service integration as later ADR. **Debt raised:** PROV-O / XES / OCEL exports shipped 2026-04-15 without hash-chain hooks — every adopter of those formats now consumes unlinkable output; retrofitting means versioning three export surfaces simultaneously.
- [ ] **#52 Simulation trace format** `[Imp 4 / Cx 3 / Debt 2]` — Normative replay semantics for simulation runs. Event log format is XES (already shipped via `wos-export::xes`). Remaining work: normative replay contract + conformance fixtures.

---

## 6 — Regulatory alignment

External-deadline-driven. Benefits from ontology (§2) landing first.

- [ ] **#50 EU AI Act alignment** `[Imp 7 / Cx 5 / Debt 4]` — Art. 13–14 alignment spec: draft → 1.0.0. Watchlist — external compliance deadlines can force escalation.
- [ ] **#50 OMB M-24-10 compliance** `[Imp 6 / Cx 4 / Debt 3]` — Compliance support spec: draft → 1.0.0. Narrower than EU AI Act; overlaps existing assurance / impact-level plumbing. More process-documentation-shaped than structural, so Debt is lower.

---

## 7 — Interoperability and speculative research

Pick up when §§2–6 stabilize.

- [ ] **SCXML interoperability** `[Imp 3 / Cx 6 / Debt 2]` — Bidirectional WOS ↔ SCXML mapping (currently informative only).
- [ ] **#51 Statutory deadline chains** `[Imp 4 / Cx 7 / Debt 5]` — Interdependent government deadlines and automated legal consequences. Architecturally expensive — wrong abstraction here is expensive. **Debt raised:** once #31 jurisdiction-aware calendars and #20 typed events land, deadline chains must compose with both; deferring past those without at least a sketch risks an incompatible construct.

---

## Deferred (with triggers)

Items captured but not active; re-score when the named trigger fires.

| IDEA # | Item | Imp | Cx | Debt | Trigger |

| #33 | Inclusive-OR / Event-Choice / Boundary Events | 3 | 5 | 2 | Authoring frustration with workarounds (externally observable signal). |

## Future specs (trigger-gated)

| Spec | Description | Trigger |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Batch Operations | Parallel case instantiation, bulk state transitions | Sustained deployments above 100 cases/minute |
| Federation Profile | Cross-org trust, signed provenance | Second organization adopts WOS |
| Learning Profile | Retraining governance | Long-lived AI agents need retraining policy |

## Rejected

Decisions locked; do not re-litigate.

| IDEA # | Item | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| #5 | DAG Processing Model | Contradicts axis 4 (append-only event-stream folding). Reactive re-evaluation explicitly rejected. |
| #8 | FEL Conformance Profiles | Kernel §7.4 rejects grammar extensions. |
| #10 | WCOS + FEEL | Rename + DMN-expression-language both abandoned. |
| #17 | SHACL | Existing Rust lint (55 T2 rules) covers cross-doc validation; SHACL would duplicate. Shipped PROV-O is JSON-LD; if output-shape validation is needed, scope a dedicated item — don't resurrect SHACL wholesale. |
| #18 | Minimal Governance Envelope | Strip lifecycle from kernel → doc that cannot be understood in isolation. |
| #19 | FEEL Expression Language | FEL is purpose-built; FEEL carries DMN assumptions. |
| — | BPMN Parity as Authoring Goal | Export target, not authoring surface. Topology rejected; event taxonomy adopted normatively via #20. |

## Parked

- [ ] Full lifecycle soundness verification (e.g. linear-time logic). Advanced Governance SMT is the path.
- [ ] JSON Patch for fine-grained provenance.
- [ ] FEEL-to-FEL migration guide — on-demand, write when first DMN shop asks.

## Open questions

1. **Engine-adapter sequencing** — TODO §3 ↔ IDEA Deferred. Defer until first commercial request, or schedule now to validate runtime against production-shape workloads?
2. **Ontology-spec authoring ownership** — who drafts, when?
3. **Timer semantics** (#20). Wall-clock or business-days for `noticeGracePeriod` legal compliance? Business calendar reference opt-in or required?
4. **Registry composition** (#21). Two L1 governance docs attaching rules to the same tag — declaration order, explicit priority, or conflict rejection?
5. **Multi-instance design** (#32). Events, arrays, or both? Governance hooks per-instance vs. per-iteration.
6. **Version migration declaration surface** (#3). Kernel carries governance version or each case? `tenant`-scope behavioral contract?
7. **Canonical forms.** Enforce "simple sequential workflow MUST be expressed as compound state with ordered children, not flat atomic sequence"?
8. **Defeasibility layer** (#25). `workflow-governance` or distinct companion? Priority encoding? Compose with `sourceAuthority` AND Integration Profile §11.2.
9. **Case-field policy vs. L2 `Right`** (#26b). Compose or supersede? Hold policy interaction. Assurance Invariant 6 independence.
10. **Cancellation region semantics** (#27). Set or predicate? Event / guard / explicit action? Compensation run / skip / author's choice?
11. **`ExternalArtifactRef` shape** (#28). 9th case-field type or `$def`? Retrieval contract — sync / deferred / action-body?
12. **Task suspension reducibility** (#30). Always reducible to `holdType: task-suspended`, or independent task state needed?
13. **Equity expression language** (#36). FEL extension, restricted DSL, or FEL + windowing?
14. **Assurance-level composition** (#43). Minimum floor per impact level, disclosure-only, or implementation-defined?
15. **JSON-LD authoring surface** (Deferred #9). Should `@context` land in authoring or stay export-only?
16. **#29b firing mechanism.** Event-based (enqueue synthetic event) or guard-based (`$milestone.*` FEL boolean)?

## Notes

**ADR references (resolved 2026-04-18).** `ADR-0057 (wos-core-implementation-boundary)` and `ADR-0058 (wos-core-gap-analysis)` live in `thoughts/archive/adr/` (implemented). A prior audit looked only in active `thoughts/adr/` and incorrectly flagged them as missing. Citations in `enterprise-implementation-roadmap.md:257`, `thoughts/plans/2026-04-13-wos-runtime-crate.md:423`, `thoughts/specs/2026-04-11-formspec-wos-phase11-integration-master.md:302`, and `specs/companions/runtime.md:51,:906` all resolve against the archive copies. No action pending — retained here so future audits don't re-raise the same flag.
