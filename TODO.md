## Do next

Pick from the top. Each item has a gate (what unblocks it) and a plan or ADR.

**Scoring note.** On this project dev time is cheap relative to architectural drift, so ordering uses **`Imp × Debt`**; Cx is preserved as a scheduling dimension (how many engineer-days) but does not change priority. On a pre-1.0 spec under rapid iteration, Debt values should trend **up** between sessions as downstream code calcifies around loose shapes — scores are re-audited when the rank shifts. Scores are `[Imp / Cx / Debt]` on a 0-10 scale; **the number in parentheses after each item is `Imp × Debt`**.

1. **#20 Typed event meta-vocabulary** `[8 / 7 / 8]` (**64**) — replace `Transition.event: string` with a 5-kind typed union. Debt raised 6 → 8: 185 fixtures / 844 occurrences already in the tree, plus every synth / bench / export / analyzer now building against the loose string shape — the surface calcifies daily. Plan: [2026-04-20](thoughts/plans/2026-04-20-wos-typed-event-meta-vocabulary.md). ~8-10 engineer-days. **Gate: ~10-min user decision on OQ1 (`$join` disposition) + OQ4 (vendor-kind extension shape). The gate is not a scheduling delay — it is a cheap decision blocking a large debt burn-down.**
2. **#48 Merkle provenance chains** `[6 / 6 / 8]` (**48**) — hash-chained tamper-evident logs via Assurance `provenanceLayer` seam. Debt raised 6 → 8: PROV-O / XES / OCEL exports shipped 2026-04-15 without hash hooks; every adopter of those formats now consumes unlinkable output, and retrofit requires versioning three export surfaces simultaneously and forcing migration on current adopters. **Gate: none.**
3. **#F3b Runtime §10.3 conformance** `[7 / 4 / 6]` (**42**) — rewrite `crates/wos-core/src/eval.rs:412-421` as a post-mutation re-scan matching Runtime §10.3. Debt raised 5 → 6: every day continuous-mode ships with spec-drift, any user who tries it builds assumptions against the ad-hoc `$continuous` sentinel the spec never defined. ADR [0059](thoughts/adr/0059-continuous-mode-post-mutation-rescan.md). Task 3 closed out-of-band (`a683c03`); Tasks 1, 2, 4, 5 remain (~2-3 engineer-days). **Gate: none — ready to execute.**
4. **Cross-reference shape ADR** `[6 / 2 / 6]` (**36**) — `calendarRef` (URI) vs `templateRef` (plain string key) vs `escalationChainRef` (local id) vs `assertionRef` (URI) already diverged across four schemas; Reviews B + D flagged session 9. Pure design debt — every new schema lands with the drift until an ADR pins the convention. **Gate: none — draft takes ~2 hours.**
5. **§4.5 Structural merges** — three merges ratified by the 2026-04-20 [sidecar audit](thoughts/reviews/2026-04-20-sidecar-contract-audit.md); highest Imp × Debt is assertion-library → workflow-governance `[4 / 2 / 5]` (**20**, debt raised 3 → 5 — every day deferred, more cross-schema `$ref` patterns entrench). See Backlog § Structural merges. **Gate: user decision — one PR or three?**

*Dropped from Do next at revised ordering:* §4.4 Release trains Tasks 4-5 (Imp × Debt = 15) and §5.5 `wos-bench` (18) — both still open and ready, live in Backlog.

---

## Backlog

### Release + benchmarking

Fell out of Do next only because `Imp × Debt` put other items higher; both are ready-to-execute with no gate.

- **§4.4 Release trains Tasks 4-5** `[5 / 4 / 3]` (**15**) — Changesets tooling + GitHub Actions release workflow. Plan: [2026-04-16](thoughts/plans/2026-04-16-wos-release-trains.md). Tasks 1-3 landed session 8.
- **§5.5 `wos-bench` synthesis benchmark** `[6 / 5 / 3]` (**18**) — live Anthropic run closes Q-V0-1..4 from the v0 spike retrospective. Plan: [2026-04-16](thoughts/plans/2026-04-16-wos-synthesis-benchmark.md).

### Behavior + authoring surface

Normal feature work. Schedule once the critical path clears.

- **#26a `AccessControl.canRead` enforcement semantics** `[6 / 3 / 4]` — normative processor behavior on `canRead → false`: redact / null / raise / skip. Prerequisite to #26b.
- **#26b `caseFieldPolicy` schema** `[6 / 6 / 4]` — per-field read/write scopes by actor role.
- **#36 Equity RemediationTrigger expression language** `[6 / 4 / 4]` — FEL extension vs. restricted DSL vs. FEL + windowing. Prerequisite to #35.
- **#35 Equity Config enforcement semantics** `[7 / 5 / 4]` — processor obligations for `RemediationTrigger.action`; wire `DisparityMethod` to runtime.
- **#24b + #25 joint design** `[#24b 7/6/4 · #25 6/7/6]` — Reasoning tier rule-firing trace + Catala-style defeasibility. Must compose with `sourceAuthority` rank (§6.2) + Integration Profile §11.2.
- **#43 Assurance × impact-level composition** `[6 / 5 / 4]` — minimum Assurance floor for AI-assisted rights-impacting determinations?
- **#30 WS-HumanTask lifecycle completion** `[5 / 5 / 2]` — task-level `Suspended`, distinct `Cancelled`, explicit `Return` with rework counter.
- **#27 Cancellation regions** `[4 / 6 / 3]` — YAWL-style named regions, distinct from existing `cancellationPolicy` join policy.
- **#28 Claim-check artifact references** `[4 / 4 / 5]` (**20**, debt raised 2 → 5: without the typed wrapper, every consumer builds field-by-field integrity checks ad-hoc; normalization later = every consumer refactors) — typed `ExternalArtifactRef { uri, contentHash, hashAlgorithm, mediaType }` with integrity-check at retrieval. `inputDigest`/`outputDigest` already wired through `wos-export`.
- **#29b Milestone reactive transition firing (GSM-style)** `[6 / 5 / 2]` — ships after #29a (landed session 4).
- **#3 Policy-based migration routing** `[5 / 6 / 2]` — `migrationPolicy: grandfather | migrateAll | migrateByState | expression`. `tenant`-scope behavioral contract is an open sub-question.

### Structural merges (§4.5)

All three ratified by the 2026-04-20 sidecar audit. See Do next item 3 for decision.

- **Assertion Library → Workflow Governance** `[4 / 2 / 5]` (**20**, debt raised 3 → 5: every day deferred, more cross-schema `$ref` patterns get entrenched instead of simple in-document refs) — absorb as "Named Assertions". `AssertionUse` seam already landed session 8; merge is mechanical.
- **Verification Report → Advanced Governance** `[3 / 2 / 2]` — it's a processor **output**, miscategorized as a sidecar.
- **Due Process Config partial merge → Workflow Governance** `[5 / 3 / 4]` — residual `independenceConstraint` / `appealRouting` / `continuationPolicies` duplicate Governance §3.1/§3.5.
- **M-1 Drift Monitor + Agent Config — BLOCKED.** `fixtures/ai/benefits-drift-monitor.json` ships standalone; ship #37 standalone binding instead.
- **M-2 Notification Template + Due Process Config — REJECTED.** 4 non-due-process categories.

### Hygiene / refactors

Organizational debt; first adopter won't notice. Schedule opportunistically when the relevant code is already being touched.

- **#22a ProvenanceKind tier-typing** `[4 / 4 / 5]` (**20**, debt raised 3 → 5: "Debt lowered 5→3 post-PE.2" was premature — PE.2 catches tier-variance at the *variant* level, not the *payload shape*; payload shape is what breaks when tier-typing lands) — tier-typed record per `audit_layer`. Consider bundling with F3b Tasks 1-2 (both touch `provenance.rs`).
- **#22 Crate split along tier boundaries** `[5 / 3 / 3]` (**15**) — `wos-core` → `wos-{kernel,governance,ai,advanced}`; `wos-runtime/runtime.rs` (4451 lines) split along action-kind dispatch; CI fence.

### Audit + evidence products

Build on the stable provenance export surface. #48 promoted to Do next under the `Imp × Debt` ordering.

- **#52 Simulation trace format** `[4 / 3 / 2]` (**8**) — normative replay contract + conformance fixtures. Event log format already shipped via `wos-export::xes`.

### Regulatory

External-deadline-driven; watch for compliance escalation.

- **#50 EU AI Act alignment** `[7 / 5 / 4]` — Art. 13-14 alignment spec, draft → 1.0.0.
- **#53 OMB M-24-10 compliance** `[6 / 4 / 3]` — process-documentation-shaped; overlaps Assurance + impact-level plumbing.

### Interoperability + speculative

Pick up once §§2-6 stabilize.

- **SCXML interoperability** `[3 / 6 / 2]` — bidirectional WOS ↔ SCXML mapping (currently informative only).
- **#51 Statutory deadline chains** `[4 / 7 / 5]` — interdependent government deadlines + automated legal consequences. Must compose with #31 business calendars + #20 typed events.

## Blocked / needs decision

Items that can't move without a verdict or an external trigger.

### Engine adapters — sequencing unresolved

TODO §3 previously scheduled engine adapters as near-term priority; IDEA_SCRATCH #49 marks them Defer with trigger "first commercial deployment requesting a specific adapter." No arbitrating document.

- **#49a Camunda 8 Worker** `[5 / 8 / 3]` — BPMN target; broadest external fixture diversity.
- **#49b Temporal Workflow** `[5 / 8 / 3]` — natural fit with WOS evaluator determinism.
- **#49c AWS Step Functions** `[5 / 8 / 3]` — broadest commercial reach; narrowest semantic fit.

### Ontology field identity

`ontology-spec.md` does not exist. Informs AI integration, cross-document alignment, and §6 regulatory specs. Prerequisite design: JSON-LD `@context` decision, semantic-field-identity protocol, cross-document alignment. Move to active only once a draft exists.

### Sidecar-audit open questions (2026-04-20)

From the 2026-04-20 [sidecar audit](thoughts/reviews/2026-04-20-sidecar-contract-audit.md); need user verdict.

1. Ship the three §4.5 merges as one PR (audit's recommendation) or three?
2. Extract a shared `targetedLookupRef` `$def` across the four divergent cross-ref shapes now, or let it emerge organically alongside §4.5?

## Deferred (with triggers)

Captured but not active; re-score when the trigger fires.

| IDEA # | Item | Imp/Cx/Debt | Trigger |
|---|---|---|---|
| #1 | Agent Behavioral Attestations | 2/7/1 | SLSA-style AI-agent attestation ecosystem matures. |
| #4 | Tripartite Object Model | 2/9/3 | Activity-definition reuse across workflows becomes a real pattern. |
| #6 | Typed Patch Operations | 1/8/0 | Authoring tool ships structural edits. |
| #7 | OCEL 2.0 Object-Centric Case Model | 2/9/5 | Multi-object mutation emerges, or flat→OCEL export shows systematic loss. |
| #9 | JSON-LD Export Surface | 5/5/3 | Ontology spec drafts begin OR shipped PROV-O pulls `@context` into authoring. |
| #32 | Multi-Instance Iteration | 6/7/5 | #20 lands. Highest-priority deferred item. |
| #33 | Inclusive-OR / Event-Choice / Boundary Events | 3/5/2 | Authoring frustration with workarounds (externally observable signal). |

---

## Future specs (trigger-gated)

| Spec | Description | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| Batch Operations | Parallel case instantiation, bulk state transitions | Sustained deployments above 100 cases/minute. |
| Federation Profile | Cross-org trust, signed provenance | Second organization adopts WOS. |
| Learning Profile | Retraining governance | Long-lived AI agents need retraining policy. |

---

## Rejected

Decisions locked; do not re-litigate.

| IDEA # | Item | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| #5 | DAG Processing Model | Contradicts axis 4 (append-only event-stream folding); reactive re-evaluation explicitly rejected. |
| #8 | FEL Conformance Profiles | Kernel §7.4 rejects grammar extensions. |
| #10 | WCOS + FEEL | Rename + DMN expression language both abandoned. |
| #17 | SHACL | Existing Rust lint (55 T2 rules) covers cross-doc validation; shipped PROV-O is JSON-LD. |
| #18 | Minimal Governance Envelope | Strip lifecycle from kernel → doc that cannot be understood in isolation. |
| #19 | FEEL Expression Language | FEL is purpose-built; FEEL carries DMN assumptions. |
| — | BPMN Parity as Authoring Goal | Export target, not authoring surface. Event taxonomy adopted normatively via #20. |

---

## Parked

- Full lifecycle soundness verification (e.g. linear-time logic). Advanced Governance SMT is the path.
- JSON Patch for fine-grained provenance.
- FEEL-to-FEL migration guide — on-demand, write when first DMN shop asks.

## Open architectural questions

Load-bearing design decisions not yet attached to a single backlog item. Ordered by frequency of downstream dependence.

1. **Typed event taxonomy** (#20). **OQ1:** is `$join` engine-synthesized-only or authored as a `signal`? **OQ4:** closed `kind` enum with `x-*` payload extension, or open `kind` admitting `x-` prefix? Both are load-bearing on #20 Task 1.
2. **Registry composition** (#21). Two L1 governance docs attaching rules to the same tag — declaration order, explicit priority, or conflict rejection?
3. **Defeasibility layer** (#25). Workflow-governance or distinct companion? Priority encoding? Compose with `sourceAuthority` AND Integration Profile §11.2.
4. **Equity expression language** (#36). FEL extension, restricted DSL, or FEL + windowing?
5. **Assurance-level composition** (#43). Minimum floor per impact level, disclosure-only, or implementation-defined?
6. **JSON-LD authoring surface** (Deferred #9). Should `@context` land in authoring or stay export-only?
