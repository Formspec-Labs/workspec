# WOS TODO

Active backlog. Completed work → [COMPLETED.md](COMPLETED.md). Stack architecture → [`VISION.md`](../VISION.md). Ordering = **`Imp × Debt`** per [`user_profile.md`](../.claude/user_profile.md) economic model (dev/time free, architectural drift expensive); Cx is scheduling-only. Score notation in ticket headers: `[Imp / Cx / Debt]`. Last audited 2026-05-15.

## Snapshot

**Where specs / schemas / crates live:** invoke the `formspec-specs:wos-core` skill — it carries the 4-layer architectural navigation (L0 Kernel / L1 Governance / L2 AI / L3 Advanced), the sidecar + profile + companion inventory, the 19 REST API spec/schema pairs, and the complete `work-spec/` file map. Don't inline that content here; it drifts.

| Operational state | |
|---|---|
| CI ratchets | `schema_doc_zero_regression` · promotion-evidence + LoadBearing-fixture coverage · promotion-candidate ratchet · **ADR 0082 D-13 Gates 1–6** (schema validity, OpenAPI `$ref` discipline, route coverage, `oasdiff` breaking-change, response conformance, mirror byte-parity) under [`.github/workflows/api-contract-guardrails.yml`](.github/workflows/api-contract-guardrails.yml) |
| Case/process identity | ADR-0093 Option B groundwork in progress (process TypeID family, `WosResourceUrn` admits `process`, N:1 process-to-case-ledger bridge routes wired). Remaining: `WorkflowProcess` rename, `/instances` → case/process route migration, post-ledger ReBAC, generic `DecisionEvent`, broader N:1 conformance. Session detail in [`COMPLETED.md`](COMPLETED.md). |
| E2E/API coverage | Server tests mostly Rust integration / in-process HTTP. Playwright API + browser E2E plan against real `wos-server`, manifest-driven from [`WOS-FEATURE-MATRIX.md`](WOS-FEATURE-MATRIX.md) 130 rows: [`../thoughts/plans/2026-05-09-wos-feature-matrix-e2e-test-plan.md`](../thoughts/plans/2026-05-09-wos-feature-matrix-e2e-test-plan.md). |
| Agent adapter state | `wos-agent-stub` ships; 5 skeleton crates (`-anthropic/-mcp/-a2a/-http/-claude-sdk`) have `unimplemented!()` invoke bodies pending orchestrator seam (ADR 0064 residual epic). |

## Gate typology & parallelization plan

Sequenced across 5 independent workstreams. Full gate audit + ADR ratification history archived to [`thoughts/plans/2026-05-06-gate-typology.md`](thoughts/plans/2026-05-06-gate-typology.md). Stream A (Identity) fully landed 2026-05-07 (#6 ADR 0092 TypeID + #7 multi-step session DAG); row retired.

| Stream | Items | Work type | Scope |
|--------|-------|-----------|-------|
| **B — Provisioning** | #3, #4, #5, #70, #71, #72, #66 (and #66a–#66g sub-items), #40 | Governance policies, runtime emission wiring, export, conformance, Runtime Companion parity | WOS center + wos-export + wos-conformance + wos-runtime |
| **C — Spec & Schema** | #26a, #26b, #50, #28, #30, #27, #29b, #53, Bulk Ops, #32, #35, #36, #38, #59, #60, #61, identity attestation, #24b/#25, #3 (migration) | Schema additions, spec prose, conformance fixtures, lint impl | WOS schemas + specs + lint |
| **D — Authoring & Tooling** | ADR 0065 cluster (`fs-uqpw`/`fs-d79a`/`fs-xkui`/`fs-s5wm`/`fs-k63f` — production seam, MCP validation, spike closure, provider hygiene, plan reconcile), §5.5 `wos-bench`, §4.4 release trains, §5.6 | MCP/synth/authoring cleanup, benchmarking, CI, docs | `wos-{mcp,synth-core,authoring,bench}` crates |
| **E — Cross-repo** | #1 T4 closeout, #2 AI orchestrator + 5 agent adapters, identity attestation cross-repo | Trellis COC, Studio UI, AgentRuntime trait, cross-repo ADR coordination | Trellis + formspec-studio + WOS crates |
| **F — Envelope productization** (added 2026-05-14) | Content-Attestation Envelope epic `fs-m8ic` + 15 child tickets — port-catalog spec (P-1..P-14), verifier facade (P-13), conformance bundles, two design decisions (`fs-n357` `documentRef` shape, `fs-wi8a` intent baseline, `fs-fqt1` port-catalog home) | DocuSign-class envelope-routed signed-content evidence | Formspec Definition + Response schema, WOS Signature Profile §2.11/§2.13.1, Trellis clarifying ADR, port catalog (likely WOS sidecar), verifier facade |

**Stream-internal sequencing:**
- **B:** Governance policies (#3/#4/#71) independent once ADRs accepted; #70 → #72 (typed-enum prerequisite for emission wiring, encoded as `fs-zjpl` deps `fs-vmsx`); export work (#4/#5) independent of runtime emission; #66a–#66g mostly independent
- **C:** #26a → #26b (encoded); #30 pairs with #58 (landed 2026-05-07); #35 → #36 (encoded); #59/#60 dependency on typed events + task lifecycle lives in ticket prose, not encoded as deps
- **D:** ADR 0065 production-seam ticket parents the synth/MCP follow-ups; plan-reconcile (`fs-k63f`) → production-seam (`fs-uqpw`); spike-closure tickets independent
- **E:** AI orchestrator (#2) blocks the 5 agent adapter invoke bodies (`fs-ixl3`/`fs-mhhv`/`fs-njef`/`fs-pizw`/`fs-wzps` all dep `fs-w9dv`); T4 COC and Studio UI independent
- **F:** Port-catalog home decision (`fs-fqt1`) → port-catalog spec (`fs-acyi`) → verifier facade (`fs-jjwc`) → conformance bundles (`fs-6pb7` → `fs-o1lw`); two foundational design choices (`fs-n357`, `fs-wi8a`) gate the schema cascade

Cross-repo Do-next #1 (WOS-T4) — workflow-tier signature slice; cross-stack rollup at `fs-w0li`. Other items below are WOS-spec-internal slices, parented here.

**P2 — standard:**

- **#4 — ADR 0066 implementation (WOS center: 7 record kinds + policies + runtime + export)** `[7/6/5]=35` · `fs-j94f` · P2
   links ADR 0066 — amendment and supersession (cross-stack rollup) `fs-lwsj`

   WOS center slice of ADR 0066 (amendment/supersession/rescission/correction). ADR Accepted 2026-05-06; cluster ratification sweep complete. LANDED: 7 ProvenanceKind variants + schema $defs + Facts-tier classification + audit_layer_for_kind tests + 2/3 export paths (PROV-O + XES). REMAINING (per checklist :256-281): governance policy sections (amendmentPolicy, rescissionPolicy, reinstatementPolicy, correctionPolicy, supersessionPolicy) each binding AppealMechanism-shaped gate + impact-level assurance floor; lint K-A-010; companion examples + fixtures emitting superseding workflow process + runtime targetCase URI validation; runtime emission on governed transitions (gated by #72); OCEL export; wos-conformance fixtures; WOS-IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md updates.

   **Acceptance:**
     - All 6 checklist sections green (kernel/provenance done; workflow governance, caseRelationship, runtime+binding, OCEL export, conformance+docs remaining).
     - Composes onto LB_T4 (fs-w0li — workflow-tier slice) and parent ADR 0066 rollup (fs-lwsj).

- **#5 — ADR 0067 implementation (WOS center: clocks runtime + export + conformance)** `[7/5/5]=35` · `fs-lq08` · P2
   links ADR 0067 — statutory clocks (cross-stack rollup) `fs-olho`

   WOS center slice of ADR 0067 (statutory clocks). ADR Accepted 2026-05-06. LANDED: clockStarted / clockResolved ProvenanceKind + schema $defs (Clock with clockId/clockKind/originEventHash/duration/calendarRef/statuteReference/computedDeadline + ClockResolved with resolution/resolvingEventHash/resolvedAt) + Facts-tier classification + Task SLA authoring surface + business calendar §7.1 infrastructure. REMAINING (per checklist :283-308): runtime emission for 4 clock kinds (AppealClock / ProcessingSLA / GrantExpiry / StatuteClock) + pause/resume per D-4; Task SLA runtime + ADR 0067 D-2.1 SlaDefinition→ProcessingSLA migration; #51 statutory deadline chain composition with §7.1; wos-export PROV-O/OCEL/XES paths for clock kinds; wos-conformance fixtures (start, satisfied, elapsed, paused segment); kernel/companion prose for MUST behavior; ADR §Open questions resolution.

   **Acceptance:** All 6 checklist sections green. Cross-stack rollup ADR_67 (fs-olho); workspec-server prove-out at wos-server WS-073.

- **#3 — Actor authorization shape (AuthorizationAttestation) — governance policy + runtime emission** `[7/4/5]=35` · `fs-u2on` · P2
   blocked-by ADR 0066 implementation (WOS center: 7 record kinds +… `fs-j94f`

   Stack contract per ADR 0066 D-2. WOS-center provenance ALREADY LANDED: ProvenanceKind::AuthorizationAttestation at kind.rs:350, schema $defs/AuthorizationAttestationRecord, Facts-tier classification, export adapters (PROV-O/XES; OCEL pending). REMAINING: governance policy sections + runtime emission wiring. ADR 0066 Accepted 2026-05-06.

   **Acceptance:**
     - Governance policy sections (workflow-governance.md) bind AuthorizationAttestation to authorizing actor; runtime emits on governed transitions; OCEL export path.
     - Tracked in ADR 0066 execution checklist items 1-2.

- **#10 — WOS-SIGNATURE-RECEIPT-CONSUMPTION-001 — VerificationReceipt consumption in wos-formspec-binding** `[6/4/5]=30` · `fs-f5ls` · P2
   links WOS-T4 cross-stack proof + signature-attestation /… `fs-w0li`

   LANDED: VerificationReceipt types (Rust + TS); signature_evidence() signature ready for receipt injection; shared Formspec COSE helpers + Ed25519 webcrypto/ring/Trellis adapters verify COSE_Sign1; runtime carries optional Formspec authoredSignatures[*].verificationReceipt bytes through SignatureEvidence into SignatureAffirmation.verificationReceipt; Posture Declaration receiptSigningRequired:true emits SignatureAdmissionFailed(posture_floor_unmet) when signed receipt bytes absent. REMAINING: dispatch to real Verifier port; produce signed VerificationReceipt bytes from adapter; map failed/unsupported receipt results into SignatureAdmissionFailed.receipt; populate byte bundles with real receipt COSE.

   **Acceptance:**
     - Real Verifier port dispatch; signed receipt bytes produced; receipt failure mapping; byte bundles carry real receipt COSE.
     - Debt 5: COSE decode shared but adapter dispatch + receipt injection remain deep surfaces.

- **#11 — WOS-POSTURE-DECLARATION-CONSUMPTION-001 — Posture Declaration consumption residual** `[6/4/5]=30` · `fs-sf0g` · P2
   links WOS-T4 cross-stack proof + signature-attestation /… `fs-w0li`

   LANDED: posturePolicy field in wos-workflow.schema.json (url + optional version); deploymentLocalSigningIntents sunset notice; PostureDeclaration schema in formspec/schemas/ and work-spec/schemas/; load_posture_declaration URL fetch/parse/cache path in wos-runtime; posture-floor admission-path tests; posture allowedMethods gates on binding-supplied signatureMethod; posture allowedSigningIntents rejects non-allowlisted intents with SignatureAdmissionFailed(method_unsupported). REMAINING: binding-driven registry-corrupt / adapter-unavailable conformance coverage once receipt/verifier dispatch exists.

   **Acceptance:** Conformance coverage of registry-corrupt and adapter-unavailable paths via binding-driven fixtures. Debt 5: posture loading adds HTTP fetch + cache + version-pinning surface.

- **#8 — WOS-SIGNATURE-ADMISSION-FAILED-RECORD-001 — SignatureAdmissionFailed wiring residual** `[7/5/4]=28` · `fs-wa59` · P2
   links WOS-T4 cross-stack proof + signature-attestation /… `fs-w0li`

   LANDED: SignatureAdmissionFailedRecord $def in wos-provenance-log.schema.json + SignatureAdmissionFailedData with 7-reason enum + recordKind enum entry + ProvenanceKind::SignatureAdmissionFailed variant + Facts-tier classification + Rust constructor + 7-reason runtime test coverage + Formspec binding parses/carries signatureMethod / reports MethodUnregistered + EvidenceDivergence / runtime posture allowedMethods/allowedSigningIntents enforcement + unregistered-but-step-matching signing intents reach admission-failure branch + runtime step intent/signer-authority/consent signedAt divergence gates emit SignatureAdmissionFailed with structured failureContext. REMAINING: actual Formspec verifier/posture/registry-corrupt/adapter paths populating remaining nonprimitive binding-reported failure reasons beyond current runtime/test adapters.

   **Acceptance:**
     - All 7 admission-failure reasons reachable from real Formspec verifier/posture/registry/adapter paths (not only test adapters).
     - Debt 4: schema + runtime structure landed; wiring to all reason paths remains.

**P3 — sustaining:**

- **#2 — AI-runtime capability-precondition emission wiring** `[6/5/4]=24` · `fs-w9dv` · P3

   Typed Rust path landed 2026-04-28 (5 unit + 6 Python schema tests pass). REMAINING: (a) runtime emission site — AI §3.3.1 step 1-3 specifies precondition evaluation but no runtime path actually evaluates Capability.preconditions (crates/wos-core/src/model/ai.rs:197); declarable but not fired. (b) JSON conformance fixture pair (blocked + permitted) under fixtures/conformance/. (c) Ergonomic constructor variant once call-site count justifies. BLOCKER (verified 2026-05-14): ADR 0064 AgentInvoker port landed (trait + 6 adapter crates) and WosRuntime accepts AgentInvokerRegistry, but ORCHESTRATOR that calls AgentInvoker::invoke() from transition execution still does not exist. DurableRuntime has no invoke_agent method; new AgentRuntime trait or method addition may be required.

   **Acceptance:**
     - Runtime emits CapabilityPreconditionEvaluated on agent invocation; JSON conformance fixture pair (blocked + permitted).
     - GATE: AI-runtime invocation seam design (orchestrator missing).

- **#14 — WOS-SIGNATURE-ADMISSION-REVOCATION-001 — revocation_policy enforcement** `[7/3/2]=14` · `fs-yciq` · P3
   links WOS-T4 cross-stack proof + signature-attestation /… `fs-w0li`

   wos-runtime/src/runtime/signature.rs:1182 carries TODO(Phase 3.3): enforce revocation_policy when present. SignaturePolicy.revocation_policy field declared (line 686) but never inspected after admission gate at line 1182 — admission succeeds even when revocation would block. No prior TODO.md entry tracked this gap.

   **Acceptance:**
     - Admission path inspects revocation_policy and rejects when policy blocks; negative conformance fixture proves revocable signer rejected after revocation; positive fixture proves non-revoked signer still admits.
     - WHY: signature profile production-readiness gates on complete enforcement; deployment setting revocation_policy gets silent non-compliance today.

## ADR execution checklists

### ADR 0066 — execution checklist (WOS center) {#adr-0066-exec-checklist}

**Gate:** [ADR 0066](../thoughts/adr/0066-stack-amendment-and-supersession.md) **Accepted 2026-05-06 (cluster ratification sweep).** Formspec Respondent Ledger work and Trellis vectors/verifier/export stay owned in parent [`TODO-STACK.md`](../TODO-STACK.md) and closed Trellis Waves 40/47 in [`../trellis/COMPLETED.md`](../trellis/COMPLETED.md); this block is the **WOS spec + schema + runtime + export** slice.

<!-- tk:start epic=fs-w5bz -->
<!-- GENERATED by scripts/generate-todo.mjs from tk epic fs-w5bz — edit tickets via tk, not this section -->

Gate: ADR 0066 Accepted 2026-05-06 (cluster ratification sweep). Formspec Respondent Ledger work + Trellis vectors/verifier/export stay owned in parent TODO-STACK.md and closed Trellis Waves 40/47; this is the WOS spec + schema + runtime + export slice.

**P2 — standard:**

- **ADR 0066 §2 — Workflow Governance (5 policy sections + K-A-010 lint)** · `fs-b4sa` · P2

   Per ADR 0066 D-2. Zero landed. Cross-link: W_71 (fs-g5nu) covers the ReinstatementPolicy $def + K-A-010 lint slice.

   **Acceptance:** Normative policy sections — amendmentPolicy, rescissionPolicy, reinstatementPolicy, correctionPolicy, supersessionPolicy — each binding an AppealMechanism-shaped gate; impact-level assurance floor (rights-impacting → authorizing actor Assurance ≥ high) per D-2; lint rule K-A-010 enforces closed five-mode amendment taxonomy; conformance fixtures.

- **ADR 0066 §6 — Conformance + docs (wos-conformance fixtures per kind + matrix update)** · `fs-hsgi` · P2

   Zero landed.

   **Acceptance:** wos-conformance fixtures per kind; WOS-IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md / matrix rows updated as applicable.

- **ADR 0066 §4 — Runtime + binding (governed-transition emission, intake protection)** · `fs-k54o` · P2

   Zero landed. Cross-link: W_72 (fs-zjpl) covers the broader reference-runtime emission wiring for all 14 cluster variants; this slice is the ADR 0066 subset.

   **Acceptance:**
     - wos-runtime (and wos-formspec-binding where intake/custody intersects) emit the 7 new records on governed transitions; intake paths never silently mutate prior responses when a correction lineage exists (ADR Context).
     - GATE: W_72 ($W_72).

**P3 — sustaining:**

- **ADR 0066 §3 — caseRelationship.type = supersedes (companion examples + runtime URI validation)** · `fs-mb3o` · P3

   Schema enum includes supersedes at schemas/api/instance.schema.json:945,957; Kernel prose at specs/kernel/spec.md:772; K-048 lint enforces x- prefix for non-standard values. Remaining: examples + runtime validation.

   **Acceptance:** Companion examples + fixtures emitting superseding workflow process; runtime validation of targetCase URI shape.

- **ADR 0066 §5 — Export (OCEL event types for amendment/supersession kinds)** · `fs-z3ll` · P3

   wos-export: PROV-O + XES event types for all 7 kinds landed (prov_o.rs:685-691, xes.rs:683-689). OCEL remains.

   **Acceptance:** OCEL event types or annotations for all 7 ADR 0066 record kinds.

**Recently closed (kept for traceability; archive when stale):**

- ~~**ADR 0066 §1 — Kernel / provenance (7 ProvenanceKind variants + tier map + tests)**~~ `fs-xe7l` · CLOSED — Seven ProvenanceKind variants (correctionAuthorized, amendmentAuthorized, determinationAmended, rescissionAuthorized, determinationRescinded, reinstated, authorizationAttestation)…

### ADR 0067 — execution checklist (WOS center) {#adr-0067-exec-checklist}

**Gate:** [ADR 0067](../thoughts/adr/0067-stack-statutory-clocks.md) **Accepted 2026-05-06 (cluster ratification sweep).** Trellis `open-clocks.json`, verifier advisories, append vectors **043–046**, `verify/018-export-043-open-clocks`, and `tamper/051-clock-calendar-mismatch` stay in parent [`TODO-STACK.md`](../TODO-STACK.md) and closed Trellis Wave 39 in [`../trellis/COMPLETED.md`](../trellis/COMPLETED.md); Formspec **StatuteClock** origination on respondent acts stays in parent [`TODO-STACK.md`](../TODO-STACK.md); reference-server prove-out is [`crates/wos-server/TODO.md`](crates/wos-server/TODO.md) **WS-073**.

<!-- tk:start epic=fs-m25i -->
<!-- GENERATED by scripts/generate-todo.mjs from tk epic fs-m25i — edit tickets via tk, not this section -->

Gate: ADR 0067 Accepted 2026-05-06. Trellis Wave 39 closed; Formspec StatuteClock stays in parent TODO-STACK.md; reference-server prove-out at WS-073.

**P2 — standard:**

- **ADR 0067 §2 — Runtime emission (4 clock kinds + pause/resume per D-4)** · `fs-7yfo` · P2

   Four clock kinds + pause/resume semantics. ADR 0067 D-2.1 deprecates SlaDefinition in favor of ProcessingSLA with kind discriminator — migration not yet done.

   **Acceptance:** AppealClock — adverse-decision / deterministic notice path (composes with Gov §4.1 #2); ProcessingSLA — intake accepted / intake-complete workflow event (with SlaDefinition→ProcessingSLA migration per D-2.1); GrantExpiry — benefit award issued transition; StatuteClock — WOS-owned triggers only (Formspec-originated use respondent-ledger path); Pause/resume per D-4 (clockResolved with resolution:paused + new clockStarted carrying residual duration, no separate ClockPaused record kind).

- **ADR 0067 §6 — Conformance + open-question encoding/deferral** · `fs-t9rl` · P2

   Zero conformance landed. Plus 3 open questions to encode or defer — filed as decision sub-tickets.

   **Acceptance:** wos-conformance fixtures (start, satisfied, elapsed, paused segment); kernel/companion prose for MUST-level behavior; resolve or formally defer the 3 ADR §Open questions (each a sibling decision ticket).

**P3 — sustaining:**

- **ADR 0067 §5 — wos-export (PROV-O / OCEL / XES for clockStarted + clockResolved)** · `fs-hfdc` · P3

   Zero landed for clock kinds across all three export paths.

   **Acceptance:** Distinct PROV-O / OCEL / XES event types or annotations for clockStarted / clockResolved.

- **ADR 0067 §4 — #51 Statutory deadline chains (compose with business calendars + typed kernel events)** · `fs-lyt8` · P3

   Business calendar §7.1 infrastructure exists at specs/sidecars/business-calendar.md:185-196 (6-step normative algorithm). Composition with typed kernel events trigger-gated. Tracked broader at W_51 (fs-wsf0).

   **Acceptance:** Compose with §7.1 business calendars + typed kernel events; revisit trigger-gate once center contract ships (ADR 0067 accepted + D-1/D-2 shipped).

- **ADR 0067 §3 — Task SLA (#40 runtime implementation)** · `fs-pdwr` · P3

   Authoring surface landed at schemas/wos-workflow.schema.json:7762-7789 (slaDefinitions, SlaDefinition, warningThresholds, breachPolicy, escalationChain). Runtime implementation tracked at W_40 (fs-96nd); this row is the ADR 0067 cross-reference for clock contract overlap.

   **Acceptance:** Runtime SLA implementation lands (per W_40); cross-reference clock contract where Task SLA durations overlap rights-impacting deadlines (gated on ADR 0067 D-2.1 migration via ADR67_L2).

**Recently closed (kept for traceability; archive when stale):**

- ~~**ADR 0067 §1 — Kernel / provenance (clockStarted + clockResolved + Clock $def)**~~ `fs-nx1i` · CLOSED — clockStarted + clockResolved ProvenanceKind variants landed at kind.rs:361-377; payload $defs (Clock with…

## Backlog

### Envelope-stack enablement (§4.7) **[Stream: C]**

<!-- tk:start epic=fs-cb7x -->
<!-- GENERATED by scripts/generate-todo.mjs from tk epic fs-cb7x — edit tickets via tk, not this section -->

Stream: C. Cross-system envelope coordination + fixtures + separation-of-duties. Spec home: integration.md.

**P2 — standard:**

- **#59 — CloudEvent envelope-flow type catalog (integration.md)** `[6/3/4]=24` · `fs-nw43` · P2
   links Content-Attestation Envelope — spec authoring `fs-m8ic`

   Normative event-type catalog in integration.md for cross-system envelope coordination: envelopeCreated, signerInvited, signerAuthenticated, signerSigned, signerDeclined, envelopeCompleted, envelopeVoided, envelopeExpired, reminderDue. DISTINCT from #20 (kernel-internal event vocabulary per transition); #59 is cross-system wire contract that identity providers, email adapters, webhook consumers speak. Without it, every WOS-based signature stack defines own event names and integration ecosystem fragments.

   **Acceptance:** 9 event types normatively defined in integration.md; CloudEvents-compliant envelope shape; conformance vector per type.

**P3 — sustaining:**

- **#60 — Envelope reference fixtures (3-5 canonical kernel docs)** `[5/3/3]=15` · `fs-eerp` · P3
   links Content-Attestation Envelope — spec authoring `fs-m8ic`

   Three to five canonical kernel documents under fixtures/kernel/envelope-*.json demonstrating composition patterns: envelope-2signer-sequential.json, envelope-parallel-witness.json, envelope-decline-reroute.json, envelope-with-approver.json, envelope-reminder-expire.json. Plus matching conformance fixtures exercising full lifecycle. FIXTURE-ONLY work — no new schema surface. Critical for lock-in: locked patterns prevent divergent re-inventions across vendors building on WOS.

   **Acceptance:** 5 envelope fixtures + matching conformance fixtures land in fixtures/. Depends on #20 typed events and #30 task-lifecycle for the decline fixture.

- **#61 — Separation-of-duties conformance fixture batch** `[5/2/3]=15` · `fs-ekr5` · P3
   links Content-Attestation Envelope — spec authoring `fs-m8ic`

   Two to three fixtures under fixtures/conformance/ exercising AccessControl seam separation-of-duties rejection: (1) agent attempts to review own output → rejected; (2) delegated human attempts to re-review as original author → rejected; (3) separation-of-duties bypass with authority override → recorded as provenance with OverrideRecord. Pairs with #23 OverrideRecord schema landing. AccessControl seam shape already in wos-core traits; missing: conformance contract that reference processors MUST reject these attempts.

   **Acceptance:** 3 SoD conformance fixtures land; reference processor rejects (1) and (2), records (3) as OverrideRecord. GATE: #23 OverrideRecord schema landing.

**Recently closed (kept for traceability; archive when stale):**

- ~~**#58 — Envelope (instance-level) status extension**~~ `fs-rw2g` · CLOSED — Extend WorkflowProcess.status with first-class declined / voided / expired discriminators.

### Release + benchmarking — ready, lower priority **[Stream: D]**

<!-- tk:start epic=fs-id17 -->
<!-- GENERATED by scripts/generate-todo.mjs from tk epic fs-id17 — edit tickets via tk, not this section -->

Stream: D. Release-train tooling + wos-bench synthesis benchmark. Lower priority.

- **§5.5 — wos-bench synthesis benchmark (Claim A falsification harness)** `[6/5/3]=18` · `fs-6qj8` · P3

### ADR 0065 — authoring stack closure (MCP / synth / spike) **[Stream: D]**

**Anchors:** [ADR 0065](thoughts/adr/0065-wos-authoring-stack-mirrors-formspec.md) · MCP plan [2026-04-17](thoughts/plans/2026-04-17-wos-mcp-crate.md) · Synth plan [2026-04-16](thoughts/plans/2026-04-16-wos-synth-crate.md) · Spike retrospective [2026-04-20](thoughts/research/2026-04-20-wos-synth-v0-spike-findings.md). Plan markdown checkboxes in those files are **stale vs `main`** in places; this subsection is the working backlog until checkboxes are rebased.

**P2 — standard:**

- **ADR-0065 — Production seam (ToolContext via shared MCP handlers + CLI wiring + purity)** `[7/5/4]=28` · `fs-uqpw` · P2

   Score [7/5/4]=28 (cluster #65a/b/c). ADR D-3 production seam + MCP plan completion §2. #65a: Implement SECOND ToolContext impl whose lint/conformance behavior matches wos_mcp tools (wos_lint, wos_run_conformance), not a parallel copy in wos-synth-core only. Needs adapter design: synth loop holds document JSON; wos_mcp::dispatch expects ProjectRegistry + project_id. Options: implicit scratch project per session, or thin wos_mcp type implementing ToolContext by delegating to existing tools::* internals. #65b: Switch wos-synth-cli from DirectToolContext to MCP-aligned ToolContext from #65a. #65c: Once #65a/b real, consider removing direct wos-lint / wos-conformance deps from wos-synth-core so loop crate stays provider-and-lint-free at crate edge.

   **Acceptance:** Second ToolContext impl uses MCP handlers; wos-synth-cli wires MCP-backed dispatch as default; wos-synth-core loses direct wos-lint/wos-conformance deps if no in-crate stopgap remains.

- **ADR-0065 — Spike + synth quality closure (#65g/h/i/j)** `[6/4/4]=24` · `fs-xkui` · P2

   #65g: Run synth against Anthropic on PO fixture; record iteration counts, dominant first-pass diagnostics, conformance repair firing, schema/FEL/governance fix mix. Update thoughts/research/2026-04-20-wos-synth-v0-spike-findings.md in place. #65h: Feed rule_id, suggested_fix, spec_ref (structured block or JSON), not only LintDiagnostic Display text (cheapest prompt-engineering win per spike). #65i: Prefer upstream wos_conformance::smoke_test_document over ad-hoc inline ConformanceFixture wrappers (spike Option B). #65j: Replace substring matching for missing $wos* marker with typed discriminant or stable error code.

   **Acceptance:** Q-V0-1..4 closed with live numbers; structured repair prompt wired; upstream conformance document gate API adopted; wos-lint parse error typed.

**P3 — sustaining:**

   #65e: wos-mcp Cargo.toml TODO — revisit rust-mcp-sdk with default-features=false + minimal features vs current hand-rolled stdio (transport swap). #65f: Exercise wos-mcp binary under REAL MCP host (e.g. Claude Desktop). Plan addendum + spike both state: v0 spike never touched MCP; silence is not proof of dual-entry correctness.

   **Acceptance:** rust-mcp-sdk transport swap decision recorded; wos-mcp binary validated against Claude Desktop (or alternative real MCP host).

   #65k: AnthropicPrompter folds CacheAnchor data into system prompt verbatim until Anthropic SDK exposes cache control; wire real cache blocks when available (crates/wos-synth-anthropic/src/lib.rs). PAIRS with monorepo audit row WOS-SYNTH-ANTHROPIC-CACHE-001 — this entry is the delivery item. #65l: schemas/synth/wos-synth-trace.schema.json exists; add/verify schemars round-trip validation test per synth plan Task 7. #65m: Do NOT extend ToolContext with speculative methods until second impl (W_65_SEAM) proves the shape.

   **Acceptance:** CacheAnchor travels through Anthropic cache-control headers (not inline); SynthTrace schema drift test passes round-trip; ToolContext discipline preserved (no speculative methods).

**P4 — backlog / trigger-gated:**

   #65n: Reconcile thoughts/plans/2026-04-17-wos-authoring-crate.md. Plan file layout (handlers/*.rs, long checkbox ladder) DIVERGES from shipped raw.rs / command.rs / project.rs. Either update plan to match reality OR extract gap list (MCP tools ↔ WosProject helpers) so obsolete steps aren't re-executed. #65o: After #65n, mark landed MCP/synth/authoring plan [x] steps against main (or add banner: 'checkboxes frozen — see work-spec/TODO.md ADR 0065 section').

   WOS-T4 runtime emission now has SignatureAffirmation.identityBinding as first concrete shape. This item GENERALIZES that shape for reuse across non-signature evidence (reviewer-policy assurance refs, amendment-authority attestations, review-gate credentials). Coordinates with parent PLN-0381, PLN-0380, PLN-0384.

   **Acceptance:**
     - Generalized IdentityAttestation shape lands in wos-core; reused by reviewer-policy assurance refs, amendment-authority attestations, review-gate credentials.
     - GATE: T4 runtime emission landed (✓); parent stack ADR ratification (SAI_IDATT = fs-cfi1).

**Maximalist cluster follow-ups (post-Session 14–16):** **[Stream: B]**

The 2026-04-28 cluster ratification landed 14 new `ProvenanceKind` variants + closed enums + DNS-tenant cap + five-mode amendment taxonomy + `InstanceStatus::Stalled` declaratively at HEAD. The items below close the **declarable-but-not-fired** gap at the runtime/adapter boundary — same shape as #2 (capability-precondition emission) and #67 ConfigurationWarning. Without them, schemas + lint ratchet ahead of the runtime and the next conformance-suite expansion will surface a wave of "declared-but-never-emitted" gaps.

   links ADR 0070 — cross-layer failure and compensation `fs-qzg6`, Trellis #6 — ADR 0070 execution: CommitAttemptFailure… `fs-uj32`

   Replace Result<_, RuntimeError> failure surface in DurableRuntime adapter contract with closed AppendFailure { Retryable, BudgetExhausted, Terminal } enum carrying typed reason codes. Today every adapter (in-memory + Restate + future) uses RuntimeError (not String) but classification of commit-attempt outcomes still string-matches into branching logic. WHY: ADR 0070 D-4.3 pins commit-failure taxonomy as substrate-classified, retry-budget-aware, with Stalled as terminal lifecycle state. NOT STARTED: no AppendFailure enum exists; CommitFailureKind enum exists in provenance layer only (record.rs:96). Composes with #72. ADR 0070 Accepted 2026-05-06.

   **Acceptance:** AppendFailure enum lands in wos-runtime DurableRuntime trait; adapters classify retryable vs budget-exhausted vs terminal; CommitAttemptFailure conformance fixture proves the three classes.

   Add ReinstatementPolicy $def to wos-workflow.schema.json Workflow Governance embedded block (parallel to amendmentPolicy / rescissionPolicy); register lint K-A-010 enforcing closed five-mode amendment taxonomy. NOT STARTED — Reinstated provenance kind exists (kind.rs:350) but no governance policy shape or lint. ADR 0066 Accepted 2026-05-06.

   **Acceptance:** ReinstatementPolicy $def in wos-workflow.schema.json; K-A-010 lint enforces five-mode amendment taxonomy; conformance fixture proves reinstatement policy gates Reinstated emission.

   **Acceptance:** All 14 cluster ProvenanceKind variants fire from runtime emission sites; conformance fixture per variant. GATE: W_70 (fs-vmsx once filed) must land first.

- **#75 — DCR runtime evaluator** `[6/5/4]=24` · `fs-1b2p` · P2

   Runtime evaluation of DCR constraint zones (Advanced §4). Schema + provenance record kinds + instance-schema DCR state exist; actual condition/response/include/exclude/milestone relation evaluation algorithm needs Rust runtime path. Maps to Feature Matrix 1.6.

   **Acceptance:** DCR runtime evaluator lands in wos-runtime; conformance fixture per relation kind; Feature Matrix 1.6 row green.

- **#26a — AccessControl.canRead enforcement semantics** `[6/3/4]=24` · `fs-l2w3` · P2

   crates/wos-synth-anthropic/src/lib.rs:9-10 folds CacheAnchor data into system prompt verbatim because SDK doesn't expose cache control. Once Anthropic SDK adds cache-control blocks, wire real cache breaks — reduces token spend, improves prompt coherence on long synth sessions. PAIRS with #65k (delivery item at W_65_PROVIDER = fs-s5wm) — this is the source-level marker discovered by audit.

### Regulatory (1.0) **[Stream: C]**

<!-- tk:start epic=fs-cmzh -->
<!-- GENERATED by scripts/generate-todo.mjs from tk epic fs-cmzh — edit tickets via tk, not this section -->

Stream: C. EU AI Act + OMB M-24-10 + repositioning docs.

**P2 — standard:**

- **#50 — EU AI Act alignment (Art. 13-14)** `[7/5/4]=28` · `fs-tjeb` · P2

   Art. 13-14 alignment spec.

## Trigger-gated

Work that does not start until an explicit external trigger fires (commercial-request, ecosystem demand, production-deployment signal, sibling-repo ratification, vendor SDK maturity). Items here are real and tracked, just not actionable today.

### FEL restricted-domain profile (#35/#36)

Cross-repo dependency on fel-core. Not blocking WOS Stream B/C/D/E/F. Sequence when fel-core restricted-domain profile ships. See [`VISION.md`](../VISION.md) §X for FEL as the only expression language; [PLANNING.md](../PLANNING.md) for fel-core coordination.

### Engine adapters (commercial-request-gated)

WOS's first production runtime target is Restate (selected by WOS-T3). Additional adapters are gated on commercial adopter request or SDK maturity.

<!-- tk:start epic=fs-x2m9 -->
<!-- GENERATED by scripts/generate-todo.mjs from tk epic fs-x2m9 — edit tickets via tk, not this section -->

- **#49a — Camunda 8 Worker engine adapter [TRIGGER-GATED]** `[5/8/3]=15` · `fs-5gg7` · P4

   BPMN target; broadest external fixture diversity. WOS's first production runtime target is Restate adapter (selected by WOS-T3). Additional adapters trigger-gated on commercial adopter request or SDK maturity.

   **Acceptance:** Camunda 8 Worker adapter implemented; conformance fixtures pass. TRIGGER: commercial adopter request.

- **#49c — AWS Step Functions engine adapter [TRIGGER-GATED]** `[5/8/3]=15` · `fs-86vh` · P4

   Broadest commercial reach; narrowest semantic fit. (#49b Temporal evaluated by WOS-T3 and deferred until Rust workflow API stabilizes.)

   **Acceptance:** Step Functions adapter implemented; conformance fixtures pass (within semantic fit limits). TRIGGER: commercial adopter request.

<!-- tk:end -->

### Interoperability + speculative

<!-- tk:start epic=fs-t0y5 -->
<!-- GENERATED by scripts/generate-todo.mjs from tk epic fs-t0y5 — edit tickets via tk, not this section -->

Trigger-gated. SCXML interop + statutory deadline chains. Land on ecosystem demand or production deployment trigger.

- **#51 — Statutory deadline chains [TRIGGER-GATED]** `[4/7/5]=20` · `fs-wsf0` · P4

   Must compose with #31 business calendars + typed kernel events (TransitionEvent, #20). Trigger: first production deployment exposes concrete need.

   **Acceptance:** Statutory deadline chain spec composes with §7.1 business calendars + typed kernel events; conformance fixture. TRIGGER: first production deployment exposes concrete need.

- **SCXML interoperability — bidirectional WOS ↔ SCXML mapping [TRIGGER-GATED]** `[3/6/2]=6` · `fs-srpg` · P4

   Bidirectional WOS ↔ SCXML mapping. Trigger: ecosystem demand.

   **Acceptance:** Bidirectional mapping spec'd; reference implementation; conformance fixture. TRIGGER: ecosystem demand surfaces.

<!-- tk:end -->

### Deferred (captured, awaiting trigger)

Captured but not active; re-score when the trigger fires.

<!-- tk:start epic=fs-8sv0 -->
<!-- GENERATED by scripts/generate-todo.mjs from tk epic fs-8sv0 — edit tickets via tk, not this section -->

- **#9 — JSON-LD Projection/Import Surface [DEFERRED]** `[5/5/3]=15` · `fs-66du` · P4

   Trigger: ontology spec drafts begin OR shipped PROV-O pulls @context into authoring.

   **Acceptance:** JSON-LD projection/import surface lands when triggered.

- **#33 — Inclusive-OR / Event-Choice / Boundary Events [DEFERRED]** `[3/5/2]=6` · `fs-20sy` · P4

   Trigger: authoring frustration with workarounds (externally observable signal).

   **Acceptance:** Inclusive-OR / event-choice / boundary events land when trigger observed.

- **Ontology field identity — semantic-field-identity protocol [DEFERRED]** · `fs-2jgz` · P4

   ontology-spec.md does not exist. ADR 0076 (product-tier consolidation) settles the lane: semantic projection/import belongs to wos-ontology-alignment sidecar, not Kernel substrate. Move to active only once a draft exists.

   **Acceptance:** Prerequisite design lands: (1) semantic-field-identity protocol; (2) cross-document alignment; (3) executable projection/import conformance. Then promote to active.

- **FEEL-to-FEL migration guide [PARKED — trigger: first DMN shop asks]** · `fs-4ef3` · P4

   On-demand documentation. Write when the first DMN shop asks; not speculative work.

   **Acceptance:** Concrete external request from a DMN-shop user lands. Then author guide.

- **JSON Patch for fine-grained provenance [PARKED]** · `fs-v532` · P4

   Speculative — finer-grained provenance shape using JSON Patch operations. No active demand; recorded for transparency. Append-only provenance with full-record events remains current model.

   **Acceptance:** Concrete use case where current provenance granularity fails to capture a needed audit signal.

<!-- tk:end -->

### Future specs (not yet authored)

Federation Profile and Bulk Operations relocated — see "Moved to Trellis" and Backlog / behavioral items respectively.

<!-- tk:start epic=fs-4uys -->
<!-- GENERATED by scripts/generate-todo.mjs from tk epic fs-4uys — edit tickets via tk, not this section -->

- **Learning Profile — retraining governance [TRIGGER-GATED]** · `fs-q0e6` · P4

   Future spec. Retraining governance. Trigger: long-lived AI agents need retraining policy.

   **Acceptance:** Learning Profile spec authored when long-lived AI agents need retraining policy.

<!-- tk:end -->
## Moved to Trellis (scope-out)

Per [`VISION.md`](../VISION.md) §XI, Trellis is the integrity layer and owns these concerns. WOS emits records via `custodyHook`; Trellis anchors them. Tracked here only to close the loop on items that used to be listed as WOS work.

- **#48 Merkle provenance chains** — Trellis. Hash-chaining + SCITT alignment are Trellis primitives.
- **Federation Profile** (cooperative trust-anchor network) — Trellis. Previously tracked as WOS Future spec.
- **SCITT strictness** (full vs. adjacent) — Trellis decides.
- **Checkpoint seal protocol** — Trellis.
- **Proof-of-inclusion + transparency-log submission tooling** — Trellis.
- **Certificate-of-completion export bundle format** — Trellis export-bundle primitive.

## Rejected

Decisions locked; do not re-litigate.

| IDEA # | Item | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| #5 | DAG Processing Model | Contradicts axis 4 (append-only event-stream folding); reactive re-evaluation explicitly rejected. |
| #8 | FEL Conformance Profiles | Kernel §7.4 rejects grammar extensions. |
| #10 | WCOS + FEEL | Rename + DMN expression language both abandoned. |
| #17 | SHACL | Existing Rust lint (55 T2 rules) covers cross-doc validation; shipped PROV-O is JSON-LD. |
| #18 | Minimal Governance Envelope | Strip lifecycle from kernel → doc that cannot be understood in isolation. |
| #19 | FEEL Expression Language | FEL is purpose-built; FEEL carries DMN assumptions. |
| — | BPMN Parity as Authoring Goal | Export target, not authoring surface. Event taxonomy adopted normatively via #20. |

## Open architectural questions

Active decisions are tracked as P0–P2 tickets in `tk` (`tag:decision`). Three WOS-scope stack-wide uncertainties pinned in [`VISION.md`](../VISION.md) §X *Active uncertainties (WOS-scope)*: **DocuSign parity scope**, **multi-tenant on Restate vs Temporal**, **rendering service for signature artifacts**. Per-ADR open questions live alongside their ADR's execution checklist epic (e.g. ADR 0067 §6 has 3 sub-tickets covering timestamp granularity, post-hoc `elapsed` semantics, and multi-jurisdictional emit shape).

*Closed-out work is archived in [COMPLETED.md](COMPLETED.md). Append there, not here.*
