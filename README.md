# WOS — Workflow Orchestration Standard

**A workflow standard designed to be authored by LLMs and, when desired, executed with AI agents.**

Part of [Formspec](https://formspec.org). Licensed under [Apache-2.0](../LICENSE) (specs, schemas, runtime) and [BSL 1.1](../LICENSE-BSL) (case portal — the browser-based case management UI at `/case-portal/`, formerly `/studio/`). See [LICENSING.md](../LICENSING.md) for details.

WOS authors a workflow as **one merged document** with seven optional embedded blocks (governance, agents, aiOversight, signature, custody, advanced, assurance) per [ADR 0076](../thoughts/adr/0076-product-tier-consolidation.md). The single top-level marker `$wosWorkflow` pins the envelope version; compliance claims compose as `$wosWorkflow@X.Y` plus a claims map enumerating which blocks are exercised. The four release streams (`wos-kernel`, `wos-governance`, `wos-ai`, `wos-advanced`) preserve their cadence and source-path mapping for repo hygiene. See [RELEASE-STREAMS.md](RELEASE-STREAMS.md) for the claims map and [COMPATIBILITY-MATRIX.md](COMPATIBILITY-MATRIX.md) for known-good envelope versions.

## Two-line pitch

Other workflow standards were designed for humans with canvases. WOS is designed for LLMs with schemas. Agents as runtime actors are a reference extension of the same design.

See [POSITIONING.md](POSITIONING.md) for the load-bearing claims behind this framing.

---

## What is WOS?

WOS is a JSON-native specification for the **governance layer** of sensitive workflows — benefits adjudication, permit reviews, fraud investigations, any process where a decision affects someone's rights. It defines what protections apply, what constraints bind AI agents, what the audit trail must contain, and what the reasoning was behind each determination.

It is designed for **machine authoring and machine validation** across two separable claims:

- **Claim A — LLM-authored workflows.** Workflows are structured data. An LLM can generate them against the schemas; static lint gives immediate structural feedback; conformance fixtures give immediate behavioral feedback. The spec → schema → lint → conformance loop is the LLM's authoring loop. 18 schemas, 197 lint rules, and a rule-coverage conformance suite make the signal precise enough to author against.
- **Claim B — Agents as first-class runtime actors.** When the workflow runs, agents are declarable participants alongside humans and services, with autonomy levels, confidence gates, deontic constraints, and drift monitoring. Optional, but native to the design via the kernel's `actorExtension` seam.

BPMN XML cannot retrofit Claim A — its visual-first representation defeats structured generation. Temporal cannot retrofit it either — it is code-first, not spec-first. Claim B is disclosed in the AI Integration layer and its conformance fixtures.

WOS does **not** replace your workflow engine. It targets Camunda, Temporal, Flowable, KIE, and Step Functions as execution substrates. The engine handles persistence, timers, crash recovery, and the full orchestration vocabulary. WOS governs the transitions that matter for rights, audit, and AI oversight.

---

## Why not extend BPMN?

BPMN is a visual process modeling language with an XML serialization. It excels at orchestration — who does what, in what order, under what conditions. WOS borrows orchestration concepts from BPMN, SCXML, WS-HumanTask, DCR Graphs, and Temporal's deterministic replay. The lifecycle model is not the invention.

The invention is the **governance semantics** — things no standard or platform currently covers:

1. **Deontic constraints on agents** — permitted, prohibited, obligated, right with fixed enforcement ordering and impact-dependent null propagation. No engine or standard implements this.
2. **Structured oversight as behavioral specification** — "independent-first" review means the system must suppress AI suggestions until the human has independently assessed. BPMN swim lanes say *who* does work, not *how* they must review it.
3. **Due process as a structural requirement** — every rights-impacting workflow must include appeal paths, adverse decision notice, and counterfactual explanation. BPMN validation checks diagram well-formedness, not whether you forgot the appeal path.
4. **Epistemic status separation in provenance** — verified facts, AI-generated narrative, and counterfactual analysis are recorded as distinct tiers. Every engine logs who/what/when. None separates "this is a verified fact" from "this is what the AI suggested" from "this is what would have changed the outcome."
5. **Authority-ranked reasoning traces** — statute > regulation > policy > guideline, recorded with every decision. No engine or standard ranks the authority of the rules that drove a decision.
6. **Impact-level-dependent behavior** — the same null value, the same fallback, the same autonomy cap behaves differently depending on whether the workflow is rights-impacting vs operational. No engine scopes behavior by impact classification.

These cannot be bolted onto BPMN as extensions. They require a different document type — which is why WOS exists as its own spec rather than a BPMN profile.

---

## Why JSON-native?

Three properties that BPMN XML cannot provide:

- **AI can generate it** — typed patch operations at the AST level, schema-constrained generation, conformance tests validating LLM-from-schema authoring. BPMN's visual-first representation doesn't support structured generation.
- **Tools can validate it** — JSON Schema for structural correctness, SHACL shapes for governance policy correctness, SPARQL for cross-workflow analysis, SMT solving for formal governance proofs. XML Schema validates structure, not governance semantics.
- **It's simultaneously linked data** — every WOS document is valid JSON, valid JSON-LD, and an RDF graph without transformation. BPMN requires a semantic lifting pipeline (RML mappings, ontology alignment) to achieve the same.

## A concrete example

A purchase-order approval: two people, three states, a guard on the dollar amount. This validates against the kernel schema and carries no governance beyond basic orchestration:

```json
{
  "$wosWorkflow": "1.0",
  "url": "https://agency.gov/workflows/purchase-order-approval",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "status": "active",
  "impactLevel": "operational",
  "actors": [
    { "id": "requester", "type": "human", "description": "Submits purchase requests" },
    { "id": "approver", "type": "human", "description": "Reviews and approves requests" }
  ],
  "lifecycle": {
    "initialState": "submitted",
    "states": {
      "submitted": {
        "type": "atomic",
        "transitions": [
          { "event": "approve", "target": "approved", "guard": "caseFile.amount <= 5000" },
          { "event": "reject",  "target": "rejected" }
        ]
      },
      "approved":  { "type": "final" },
      "rejected":  { "type": "final" }
    }
  },
  "caseFile": {
    "fields": {
      "amount":      { "type": "number" },
      "description": { "type": "string" },
      "requestDate": { "type": "date" }
    }
  }
}
```

Add governance, AI constraints, or equity rules as separate layered documents when the risk profile requires them.

## How the layers work

WOS has one required layer and three optional ones. Each builds on the one below it. Three cross-cutting profiles and two companions attach without new kernel extension points.

### Layer 0 — Kernel (required)

States, transitions, guards, case data, actors, relationships. Every transition emits provenance. Two conformant processors given the same kernel and the same events produce the same result. The lifecycle model draws from SCXML (nested states, history states), WS-HumanTask (actor roles), and Temporal (deterministic replay).

### Layer 1 — Governance (optional)

Due process for adverse decisions, five structured review protocols (independent-first, consider-opposite, calibrated confidence, dual-blind, unassisted), validation pipelines, delegation of authority with legal instrument references, hold policies, and authority-ranked reasoning traces. This layer is where most of the genuine invention lives.

### Layer 2 — AI Integration (optional)

Agent registration with deontic constraints, autonomy levels capped by impact classification, confidence thresholds with decay across multi-step flows, mandatory fallback chains that terminate in human review, drift monitoring, and disclosure requirements for AI-assisted decisions (EU AI Act Article 13, OMB M-24-10 alignment).

### Layer 3 — Advanced Governance (optional)

DCR-style constraint zones for flexible investigation work (drawn from DCR Graphs — condition/response/include/exclude/milestone relations with three-state marking). Equity guardrails monitoring aggregate disparity without blocking individual cases. SMT verification reports proving governance constraints safe for all inputs.

### Cross-cutting profiles

- **Integration Profile** — Connects case data to external APIs (OpenAPI, Arazzo), event systems (CloudEvents), policy engines (OPA, Cedar), and tools. Maps data out, maps results back.
- **Semantic Profile** — JSON-LD contexts, PROV-O provenance alignment, SHACL governance shapes, XES process mining export.
- **Signature Profile** — Governs signature workflow semantics: signer roles, signing order, consent and identity binding, reminders, expiry, decline, void, reassignment, and `SignatureAffirmation` provenance.

### Companions

- **Lifecycle Detail** — Evaluation order, nested entry/exit, parallel region activation, compensation (saga), history-state resumption, and a bidirectional SCXML mapping.
- **Runtime** — Case instance serialization, event delivery contract, intake-handoff acceptance, and the Formspec coprocessor handoff (how accepted intake becomes a governed case or attaches to one).

## What to adopt

Only the kernel is mandatory. Add layers as the risk profile demands.

| Workflow type | Layers needed |
|--------------|---------------|
| Simple approval, low risk | Kernel |
| Human workflow with review and appeal | Kernel + Governance |
| AI-assisted decisions | Kernel + Governance + AI Integration |
| Adaptive case management, equity monitoring | + Advanced Governance |
| External APIs, policy engines, events | + Integration Profile |
| Linked data, PROV-O, process mining | + Semantic Profile |

The spec does not give AI a separate, weaker track — agents participate under the same governance structures as humans.

## Specification inventory

Per [ADR 0076](../thoughts/adr/0076-product-tier-consolidation.md), the WOS schema family is consolidated to **6 files**. One author-time core (`wos-workflow.schema.json`) carries the workflow lifecycle plus seven optional embedded blocks (governance, agents, aiOversight, signature, custody, advanced, assurance). Two sidecars (`wos-delivery`, `wos-ontology-alignment`) join by `targetWorkflow` URI. Two runtime artifact schemas (`wos-case-instance`, `wos-provenance-log`) and one tooling schema (`wos-tooling`) round out the family.

| Role | Spec | Schema |
|---|---|---|
| Author-time core | [`kernel/spec.md`](specs/kernel/spec.md) (the merged kernel spec post-ADR-0076 absorption — §1-§16 cover lifecycle, case state, provenance, durable execution, extension seams, runtime serialization, evaluation modes, Formspec coprocessor, separation principles, contract validation, host interfaces) | [`wos-workflow`](schemas/wos-workflow.schema.json) |
| Sidecar (delivery) | (schema descriptions are the canonical surface; see [`specs/sidecars/README.md`](specs/sidecars/README.md)) | [`wos-delivery`](schemas/sidecars/wos-delivery.schema.json) |
| Sidecar (ontology) | (schema descriptions are the canonical surface; see [`specs/sidecars/README.md`](specs/sidecars/README.md)) | [`wos-ontology-alignment`](schemas/sidecars/wos-ontology-alignment.schema.json) |
| Runtime artifact (instance) | n/a (produced by processors) | [`wos-case-instance`](schemas/wos-case-instance.schema.json) |
| Runtime artifact (audit log) | n/a (produced by processors) | [`wos-provenance-log`](schemas/wos-provenance-log.schema.json) |
| Tooling | n/a (consumed by tooling) | [`wos-tooling`](schemas/wos-tooling.schema.json) |

The behavioral specs that govern processor obligations live alongside the kernel spec:

| Layer | Spec |
|---|---|
| Kernel (L0) | [`specs/kernel/spec.md`](specs/kernel/spec.md) — §1-§16 |
| Workflow Governance (L1) | [`specs/governance/workflow-governance.md`](specs/governance/workflow-governance.md) — due process, review protocols, validation pipelines, holds, delegation |
| AI Integration (L2) | [`specs/ai/ai-integration.md`](specs/ai/ai-integration.md) — agent declarations, deontic constraints, autonomy, drift |
| Advanced Governance (L3) | [`specs/advanced/advanced-governance.md`](specs/advanced/advanced-governance.md) — DCR, equity, SMT verifiable constraints |
| Assurance | [`specs/assurance/assurance.md`](specs/assurance/assurance.md) — assurance levels, attestation |

<details>
<summary>Legacy spec inventory (pre-ADR 0076 — files retained as redirect stubs while citation sweep is in flight)</summary>

The pre-consolidation 17-document framing (one document per layer + sidecar + companion + profile) is being phased out. The companion + profile docs below carry "Fully migrated" banners pointing at the post-consolidation homes; the schema files in those legacy directories are subsumed by the merged `wos-workflow.schema.json` per ADR 0076 D-6. Files retained pending citation sweep:

- [`specs/companions/lifecycle-detail.md`](specs/companions/lifecycle-detail.md) — §2-§6 absorbed into kernel §4.6/§4.7/§4.8/§4.14, §9.5, §9.7
- [`specs/companions/runtime.md`](specs/companions/runtime.md) — §3-§15 absorbed into kernel §11/§12/§13/§16, governance §3.8/§11.4/§12.4, AI §4.6
- [`specs/profiles/integration.md`](specs/profiles/integration.md) — §3-§7/§9 absorbed into kernel §9.2; §10/§11 relocated to `docs/adapters/integration-extensions.md`
- [`specs/profiles/signature.md`](specs/profiles/signature.md) — content lives in `wos-workflow.schema.json` `signature` block; prose normative sections still here
- [`specs/profiles/semantic.md`](specs/profiles/semantic.md) — schema renamed to `wos-ontology-alignment` per ADR 0076 D-3

## Reference implementation

Five Rust crates in this repository:

| Crate | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| [`wos-core`](crates/wos-core/) | Typed models, lifecycle evaluation, deontic rules, provenance, contract ordering |
| [`wos-lint`](crates/wos-lint/) | Static analysis — 197 constraints across three tiers, all with test witnesses |
| [`wos-conformance`](crates/wos-conformance/) | Dynamic scenario runner — 146 JSON test fixtures that drive the runtime and assert correct behavior |
| [`wos-runtime`](crates/wos-runtime/) | Orchestration layer — persistence, queues, simulated time, milestone evaluation |
| [`wos-formspec-binding`](crates/wos-formspec-binding/) | Formspec coprocessor — prefill, response validation, mapping form data into case state |

### Running the tests

This tree is checked out as `formspec-stack/wos-spec/`, a sibling of `formspec-stack/formspec/` and `formspec-stack/trellis/` under the [formspec-stack](https://github.com/Formspec-org/formspec-stack) umbrella. The workspace depends on `fel-core` at `../formspec/crates/fel-core`. Standalone clones do not build until hosted published packages exist.

From `formspec-stack/wos-spec/`:

```bash
cargo nextest run -p wos-core
cargo nextest run -p wos-runtime
cargo nextest run -p wos-conformance
```

With [cargo-nextest](https://nexte.st/) installed:

```bash
cargo nextest run -p wos-core -p wos-authoring --status-level all
```

**Why a run can look “hung” (it usually is not):**

1. **Piping to `tail` (or any pipe)** — When stdout is not a TTY, Cargo often **block-buffers** output. A long compile phase may print **nothing** until a large buffer flushes or the process exits; `tail -N` also tends to show little until the writer closes. Prefer running nextest **without** a pipe, or use `stdbuf -oL -eL`, or `tee nextest.log`.
2. **`CARGO_TERM_PROGRESS_WHEN=always` in CI / scripts** — Cargo may error with *progress requires a `width` key* when there is no terminal width. Use the default, a real TTY, or set a width if you force `always`.
3. **First compile** — Cold builds of several workspace crates can take a minute or more; nextest’s per-test lines only appear after binaries are built.

### Intake acceptance tests (`FormspecBinding` + `WosRuntime`)

`wos-formspec-binding` already depends on `wos-runtime`. Do **not** add
`wos-formspec-binding` as a **dev-dependency** of `wos-runtime` to register
`FormspecBinding` in `wos-runtime` unit tests: Cargo can compile two incompatible
`wos-runtime` packages, so `IntakeAcceptanceAdapter` implementations no longer
match the registry's trait object.

Integration tests that need both crates live under
`crates/wos-formspec-binding/tests/` (for example `runtime_intake_workflow_alias.rs`).
Run: `cargo nextest run -p wos-formspec-binding`.

## Intellectual ancestry

WOS did not invent lifecycle modeling. It combines proven concepts with novel governance semantics:

| Concept | Ancestor | What WOS adds |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| Nested states, history states, parallel regions | SCXML / Harel statecharts | Governance hooks on every transition, provenance emission |
| Actor roles, task lifecycle | WS-HumanTask | Impact-level-dependent behavior, structured override with authority ranking |
| Deterministic replay, durable execution | Temporal | Governance-constrained replay — deontic violations are replayed, not just state transitions |
| Condition/response relations, milestone marking | DCR Graphs | Constraint zones inside a statechart, with SMT satisfiability verification |
| Task assignment, SLA, escalation | BPMN / every engine | Breach policies tied to impact level, authority-ranked reasoning traces on escalation |
| Deontic constraints, structured oversight, due process, epistemic provenance | **WOS** | No prior standard or platform covers these. This is the invention. |

## Project status

WOS is maintained by Michael Deeb as part of Formspec under Apache-2.0 / BSL 1.1. The specification is **pre-release**; there are no production deployments yet.

**Shipped:** 18 specs, 18 schemas, 41 workflow samples, 146 dynamic conformance scenarios (all green), 197 lint constraints (all with test witnesses), five Rust crates, the Runtime S15 coprocessor protocol, and seven completed code-review rounds.

**Not shipped:** Production deployments, engine-specific bindings (Camunda, Temporal, Step Functions), runtime processors for the Integration Profile sidecars, WCAG/FedRAMP/NIST audits, a formal governance body beyond the maintainer.

**If development stopped:** Your workflow JSON is yours. The schemas are public. Any team can implement the spec independently. The product is the document, not a hosted service.

**Licensing:** Apache-2.0 applies to specs, schemas, and runtime crates. BSL 1.1 applies to the case portal (the browser-based case management UI at `/case-portal/`, formerly `/studio/`), converting to Apache-2.0 in April 2030. Workflow JSON you author is your data. See [LICENSING.md](../LICENSING.md) for details.
